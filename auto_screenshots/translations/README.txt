This directory contains PO files for each language that is used in tests and
screenshot generation. All PO files in a given language directory will be
imported when a new language is enabled in the test run.

When adding a new language, download files from
https://localize.drupal.org/download for that language for the latest versions
of the following projects:

- Admin Toolbar
- MAYO (theme)
- Drupal core

Until https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3011146 is fixed, also
download the translations for an older version of Drupal Core, such as
8.5.9. (Although the older versions are not shown on the download page, the
files can still be downloaded by manually entering the download URL in your
browser.)
