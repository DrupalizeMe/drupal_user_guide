 * @file
 * Post-processes FO XML files.

 * Use with care -- things in the output directory will be overwritten!
 *
 * Command-line arguments: Source file, output file.
 *
 * This processing does the following:
 * - Replaces certain characters with ASCII equivalents, including
 *   non-breaking spaces (become regular spaces), and things like this, to
 *   avoid having characters that are not part of certain fonts.
 * - Removes language attributes throughout the file, to work around an FOP bug
 *   that causes problems with "complex script" languages if these attributes
 *   are present. See Apache issues:
 *   https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-2728 (issue we filed)
 *   https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-2093 (underlying issue)
