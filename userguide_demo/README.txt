This module does not do anything directly. All it contains is tests,
which can be used to generate screen shots and (eventually) a database
dump and files directory so you can clone the demo site.

MAKING SCREENSHOTS
------------------

These steps need to be done once to get your Firefox browser and tools set up:

1. Open up Firefox, and install the "Greasemonkey" add-on.

2. From the Greasemonkey menu, choose "New user script". Type in some name and
   click OK. It should pop up an editing window.

3. In place of the entire text in that window, copy in the contents of the
   greasemonkey_screenshot.js file in this directory. You may need to do
   something special to enable pasting into the editor.

4. Save the file.

5. You'll need to have the "import" command installed from ImageMagick. On
   Linux, use one of the following commands:

sudo apt-get install imagemagick
yum install imagemagick


Once you have the Greasemonkey script and ImageMagick set up, to make
screenshots:

1. Put this module directory (or the entire parent project directory) into the
   top-level 'modules' directory in a Drupal 8 site.

2. Enable the Testing module in the Drupal 8 site.

3. Go to admin/config/development/testing (Configuration / Development /
   Testing).

4. Run the "UserGuideDemoTestEn" test interactively and wait for it to
   finish (or the one for the language you want to generate).

5. At the bottom of the page, you should see a form (from the Greasemonkey
   script). Enter the values and click the button. You'll need to supply:

- The output directory where you'd like the screen shots to be saved,
  as either absolute path or relative to where you plan to run the scripts.
- The window ID for your Firefox window. You can find this by running the
  xwininfo command and clicking in the Firefox window.  It should be something
  like 0x3200078. Or you can use the window name (if you can figure out what
  that would be).
- The Y offset - how many pixels to offset the images, to get past all of the
  Firefox toolbars in your Firefox window. It should be about 50 pixels per
  line of toolbars you have visible.
- The timeout - how long to wait for the page to load before taking the
  screenshot, in seconds. 1 is probably enough.

6. The screen shot commands should appear below the form. Copy and paste them
   into a script, and run the script at the command line. Then close up all
   the Firefox windows it opened up.

NOTE: You need to run the screen shot script before you leave the testing
output page, because the Testing module will delete all output once you
leave the page.

NOTE 2: You may want to run just one command to begin with, to see how it works,
and then adjust the Y offset and timeout.


MORE DETAILS FOR THE CURIOUS
----------------------------

You can look at the output before you make screen shots. There are links that
say "Screen shot output", and below each one is a line like:

SCREENSHOT filename.png 200 500 200 200 http://example.com/long_url_here

The numbers are the width, height, and offset x/y of the screen shot, relative
to the browser window. The desired file name and URL where the output can be
viewed are also given (this is the URL of the "Screen shot output" link in the
line above).

The Greasemonkey script finds these SCREENSHOT lines in the output, and
parses them (along with the information you entered in the form) to make the
screen shot script.

For developers... The screen shot output is generated by a custom method
in the UserGuideDemoTest class called setUpScreenShot(). It generates a
clean output file (without the headers that are usually on a drupalGet()),
as well as the SCREENSHOT line for the Greasemonkey script to parse.
