==== Goal

Change the permissions for the Vendor role so that users can create, edit,
and delete Recipe and Vendor content, format the content, and contact each
other.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<user-concept>>

==== Site prerequisites

The Vendor role must exist on your site. See <<user-new-role>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _People_ > _Roles_
(_admin/people/roles_). The _Roles_ page appears.

. Click _Edit permissions_ in the dropdown for the Vendor
role. The _Edit role_ page appears where you can see all the available
actions for the website such as, for example, _Post comments_ or _Use advanced
search_. The available permissions depend on the modules that are installed in
the site. Note: Some permissions may have security implications. Be cautious
while assigning permissions to roles.

. Check the boxes for the following permissions, listed by module:
