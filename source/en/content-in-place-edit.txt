==== Goal

Use the in-place editor to edit existing content without opening the full editor
page.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<planning-data-types>>
* <<content-create>>
* <<content-edit>>
* <<config-overview>>

==== Site prerequisites

You must have created some content on your site, such as a _Basic page_ content
item for the Home or About page.

==== Steps

To edit content in place, start by viewing the content you want to edit. If the
page containing the content you want to edit has not yet been added to a
navigation menu, you can find and open it by following these steps:

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Content_ (_admin/content_).

. If the content item you want to edit was updated or created recently, it
should appear near the top of the content list on that page. If not, you can
use the Type, Title, or other filters to locate the content item.

. Find the page you want to edit, and click the title link to view it.

Once the content you want to edit is being viewed in your browser, follow these
steps to use the quick editor:

[start=1]
. Find the section of the page that displays the content you want to edit, and
turn on quick editing mode using the _Quick edit_ contextual link (see
<<config-overview>> for instructions on how to access contextual links). You
will see each editable field on this content item outlined in blue; also,
a hovering dialog box will appear.

[start=2]
. Click the name of the field you want to edit, such as the _Title_ or _Body_.
If the field supports a rich text editor, the editing toolbar will be
displayed in the hovering dialog.

. Make the edits you want to make. A _Save_ button will appear in the hovering
dialog, and the field outline will change color.

[start=4]
. If you are satisfied with your edits, click _Save_ in the hovering dialog
box. If not, click _X_ to discard your edits, and confirm. Either way, quick
editing mode will be turned off.

==== Follow-on tasks

Try using the full editor on the same content (see <<content-edit>>) and note
that there is much more information that can be edited that is not available in
the quick editor.
