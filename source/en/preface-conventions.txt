=== UNFINISHED - Conventions of the Guide

This page will eventually include notes about:

* How we indicate values for forms (tables and images)
* etc.

==== Text conventions

The following conventions are used in this guide:

* Text you will see in the user interface of your site is shown in _italics_,
  such as: Click _Save configuration_.
* Text that you would type at a shell command line will be in monospace type,
  such as:

----
drush cr
----

==== Navigation

To do most of the task-oriented topics in this guide, you will need to navigate
to one or more pages in the administrative interface of your site. You might see
something like this in the instructions:

=============
In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to
_Structure_ > _Taxonomy_ (admin/structure/taxonomy).
=============

This instruction assumes that you have the Drupal core Toolbar module enabled,
and it means that in the menu bar at the top of your site, you would need to
click on _Manage_ to expose the menu choices, then click on _Structure_, then on
_Taxonomy_, and that at the end, you would be on a page with URL
_http://example.com/admin/structure/taxonomy_ (if your site base URL is
_http://example.com_).

// Screen shot of the top bar of any admin page, with the Manage menu
// showing.

Here's another example:

=============
In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to
_Configuration_ > _System_ > _Site information_
(admin/config/system/site-information).
=============

In this case, after clicking on _Manage_ and _Configuration_, you would need to
find the _System_ section of the page, and within that, click on _Site
information_.

_Configuration_ page",width="100%"]
