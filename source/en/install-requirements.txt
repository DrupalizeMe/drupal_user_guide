To install and run Drupal your web server must meet certain minimum
requirements.

// ==== Prerequisite knowledge

// Note: The "What is a ..." normal template section does not really
// make sense for this topic.
//==== What is a ...?

==== Disclaimer

Note that the minimum requirements of Drupal core can be subject to
change, given an important enough reason. Where such a change is
likely to have broad impact on Drupal's user base, every effort will
be made to communicate these decisions ahead of time.

==== Disk space

A minimum installation requires 15 Megabytes. 60 MB is needed for a
website with many contributed modules and themes installed. Keep in
mind you need much more for the database, files uploaded by the users,
media, backups and other files.

==== Web server

Apache, Nginx, Hiawatha, or Microsoft IIS

===== Apache (Recommended)

Apache is the most commonly used web server for Drupal. Drupal will
work on Apache 2.x hosted on UNIX/Linux, OS X, or Windows that have
the mod_rewrite module installed and enabled.

The Apache Virtualhost configuration must contain the directive
AllowOverride All to allow Drupal's .htaccess file to be used.

===== Nginx

Nginx is a commonly used web server that focuses on high concurrency,
performance and low memory usage. Drupal will work on Nginx 1.1 or
greater hosted on UNIX/Linux, OS X, or Windows. The
ngx_http_rewrite_module must be installed and enabled.

===== Hiawatha

Hiawatha is a web server with a strong focus on security. It also aims
at being easy to use and being lightweight. Research performed by
independent researchers proves that Hiawatha offers a performance
comparable to other web servers under normal conditions, but much
better while under attack. URL Toolkit must be installed and
configured to rewrite URLs.

===== Microsoft IIS

Microsoft IIS is a web server and set of feature extension modules for
use with Microsoft Windows. Drupal will work with IIS 5, IIS 6, or IIS
7 if PHP is configured correctly.

Because clean URLs are required in Drupal 8, you may need to use a
third party product. For IIS 7 you can use the Microsoft URL Rewrite
Module or a third party solution.

==== Database

MySQL - 5.5.3 (MariaDB 5.5.20, Percona 5.5.8) or higher with an
InnoDB-compatible primary storage engine.

PostgreSQL - 9.1.2 or higher.

SQLite - 3.4.2 or higher.

==== PHP

PHP 5.5.9 or higher.
