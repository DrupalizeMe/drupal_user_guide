// ==== Prerequisite knowledge

==== What are the requirements for running Drupal?

To install and run Drupal your web server must meet certain minimum
requirements.

===== Disk space

A minimum installation requires 15 Megabytes. 60 MB is needed for a
website with many contributed modules and themes installed. Keep in
mind you need much more for the database, files uploaded by the users,
media, backups and other files.

===== Web server

Apache (Recommended)::
  Apache is the most commonly used web server for Drupal. Drupal will
  work on Apache 2.x hosted on UNIX/Linux, OS X, or Windows that have
  the mod_rewrite module installed and enabled.
  The Apache Virtualhost configuration must contain the directive
  AllowOverride All to allow Drupal's .htaccess file to be used.
Nginx::
  Nginx is a commonly used web server that focuses on high concurrency,
  performance and low memory usage. Drupal will work on Nginx 1.1 or
  greater hosted on UNIX/Linux, OS X, or Windows. The
  ngx_http_rewrite_module must be installed and enabled.
Hiawatha::
  Hiawatha is a web server with a strong focus on security. It also aims
  at being easy to use and being lightweight. Research performed by
  independent researchers proves that Hiawatha offers a performance
  comparable to other web servers under normal conditions, but much
  better while under attack. URL Toolkit must be installed and
  configured to rewrite URLs.
Microsoft IIS::
  Microsoft IIS is a web server and set of feature extension modules for
  use with Microsoft Windows. Drupal will work with IIS 5, IIS 6, or IIS
  7 if PHP is configured correctly.
  Because clean URLs are required in Drupal 8, you may need to use a
  third party product. For IIS 7 you can use the Microsoft URL Rewrite
  Module or a third party solution.

===== Database

Use one of the following databases:

* MySQL - 5.5.3 (MariaDB 5.5.20, Percona 5.5.8) or higher with an
InnoDB-compatible primary storage engine.

* PostgreSQL - 9.1.2 or higher.

* SQLite - 3.4.2 or higher.

===== PHP

PHP 5.5.9 or higher.
