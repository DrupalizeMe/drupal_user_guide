translated content type, you need to revisit the language settings. See
<<language-content-config>>.

* <<structure-image-styles>>.

* Manage the display of the Vendor and Recipe content types. See
<<structure-content-display>>.

* Manage the display of form of the Vendor and Recipe content types. See
<<structure-form-editing>>.
