[start=11]
. Add a Main Image field to the Recipe content type, using similar steps. Start
by navigating to the Recipe content type's _Manage Fields_ page in step 1. Then
skip to step 7 and follow the remaining steps, but reuse the existing Main Image
field you created for the Vendor content type rather than creating a new
field. In subsequent steps, some of the configuration screens will not be
available, because of the field reuse.

. Create two Vendor content items (see <<content-create>>), such as for vendors
called "Happy Farm" and "Sweet Honey". Make sure that they include images and
URLs.
