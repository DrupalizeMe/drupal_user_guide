=== Updating Drupal core

(((Drupal core,updating)))

==== Goal

In this section, we will learn how to update our Drupal core from one minor 8.x
version to another minor 8.x version. Say for example, from version 8.0 to 8.1
or from 8.0 to 8.2. For demonstration purpose, we will consider updating _Drupal
8.0.0-beta13_ to _Drupal 8.0.0-beta14_ (latest version at the time of writing
this document). Moreover, we assume that the Drupal 8 application we intend to
update is accessible at http://www.example.com.

Additionally, we can update Drupal 8 core primarily using two different
methods. These methods are; firstly, using the administer interface, and
secondly, using Drush.

//==== Prerequisite knowledge

==== Site prerequisites

Prior to stepping into the actual update procedure, it is recommended to ensure
the following points:

* In order to use Drush with Drupal 8.x applications, ensure that you have Drush
7.x version installed. Drush versions less than 7.x doesn't support Drupal
8.x. If you wish to explore further into Drush and its usage, we recommend
you to refer https://github.com/drush-ops/drush["Drush repository"]. Moreover,
in case you don't have Drush installed on your server, <<install-tools>> will
guide you on this.

* We encourage you to test Drupal core update process in some test or
development environment, and later proceed to the production environment upon
success. <<install-dev-making>> recipe of the guide will help you how to setup
your development environment for your Drupal 8 application.

==== Steps

. Take a backup of your code as well as database. It will help you in disaster
recovery process, in case anything goes wrong during update process. You are
recommended to refer <<prevent-backups>> to learn more about taking the
complete backups of your site.

. Open the _/sites/default/settings.php_ file in any of the text editors of your
choice. Find the line about _$settings['update_free_access']_ variable. By
default, it is set to *FALSE* due to security reasons, and to ensure that Drupal
8 core doesn't accidently get updated leading to disaster.  Edit it so it says:
+
----
$settings['update_free_access'] = TRUE;
----

[start=3]
. Disable any caching technique (memcache, varnish, and so on) your application
might be using.

. Put your site in to <<extend-maintenance, maintenance mode>>.

. Download Drupal 8.x core latest version (preferably, stable version) manually
from https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal[Drupal.org Drupal Core Downloads] and
extract it to some backup or temporary directory on your server (should be
outside the directory where the site is hosted). You may use Drush command
instead, in order to achieve the same by navigating to the backup or temporary
directory on the server and enter this command on your Drush command prompt:
+
----
drush dl drupal
----

[start=6]
. Delete the _core_ directory, and all the independent files, including
_.htaccess_, _composer.json_,_autoload.php_, and so on from your Drupal 8
installation directory. In case, you had included any custom file or
customized any of these files, it is *not recommended* to delete them; else
you may end up losing the custom functionalities that use these
custom/customized files.

. Copy the _core_ directory and the non-custom/non-customized files that you may
have deleted during the preceding step from the newly downloaded code base (in
our case, _drupal-8.0.0-beta14_) and paste them to your Drupal 8 site
directory (version _8.0.0-beta13_).

. Run the _update.php_ script using either of the following, and let the script
do its job:
+
*Using Browser interface:*
+
http://www.example.com/update.php
+
*Using Drush command:*
+
----
drush updb //where, updb is the alias of pm-updatedb
----

[start=9]
. In case you get to see any error or warning, you are advised to re-run the
_update.php_ script again until all the updates have been completed
successfully.

. Either navigate to _Configuration > Development > Performance_ and clear the
cache using the administer interface; or run the following Drush command:
+
----
drush cc all //where cc is the alias of clear-cache
----

[start=11]
. Open the _/sites/default/settings.php_ file in a text editor. Find the line
about _$settings['update_free_access']_ and edit it so it says:
+
----
$settings['update_free_access'] = FALSE;
----

[start=12]
. Put your site out of the <<extend-maintenance, maintenance mode>>.

. In case you are using any caching technique (varnish, memcache, or so on) and
had disabled at *step 3*, re-enable them; else, skip this step.

. By now, you should be able to have the updated version running. To cross
verify the current version of your drupal site, navigate to _Reports > Status
report_. Following screen shot demonstrates the status report with the desired
output encircled:
+
// Login to your Drupal 8 site as an administrator and navigate to _Reports >
// Status report_ page. Add a circle around the Drupal version.

*Note:*
Upon clearing the cache, you may come across some error(s) that might ask you to
rebuild your registry. This is sometimes essential in case some module might
have moved around during the update process. In order to get rid of such error
messages, we recommend you to follow the instructions on the
https://www.drupal.org/project/registry_rebuild[Drupal.org page "Registry
Rebuild"].

You may also refer _/core/UPGRADE.txt_ within your Drupal 8 installation in case
you want to learn more about updating Drupal 8 core.
