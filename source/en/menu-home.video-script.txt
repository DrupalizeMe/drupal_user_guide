Slide (title): In this tutorial, we’ll designate a front page for our website.

Slide (goal): By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how to configure which content item is displayed as the front page of your website.

Slide (prereq): To follow along, the content item that you want to designate as the front page of your website must exist. We created the home page content item in the tutorial “Creating a Content Item”. See the written tutorial for a link.

Demo:

1. In the Manage administrative menu, navigate to Configuration > System > Basic site settings, which is the  admin/config/system/site-information path.
2. Under Front page, replace /node with the name of the page you would like to make the home page. To use the home page that was previously created, provide its path /home. Click Save configuration.
3. Navigate to the home page to verify that it displays content as configured by you.

Slide (recap): In this tutorial, we designated the “Home” page content item to be the front page of our website.
