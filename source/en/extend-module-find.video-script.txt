=== Finding Modules

(Slide/Intro)
How to search and evaluate modules on Drupal.org.

(Slide/Goal)
Find and evaluate modules on _Drupal.org_.

(Slide/Prerequisites)
- Concept: Drupal as a Content Management System
- Concept: Modules

If you need help with any of these prerequisites consult the written version of this tutorial for links.

(Demo/Browser)

. Go to https://www.drupal.org, and navigate to _Download &
Extend_ > _Modules_ (https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module).

. Filter your search using the categories on the module search page.
We'll be looking for Actively maintained modules in the Administration category.
We want to find a module compatible with Drupal 8, so we set the core compatibility.
_Sandbox projects_ are experimental projects. _Full projects_ have already gone through an approval process, but they can still be in development.
We're going to choose full projects in this case.
Let's search for _Admin Toolbar_, a module that will be covered in detail later. Alternatively, you can also leave the field blank if you are not sure which module to search for.
Order your search results by criteria like _Most installed_ (popular modules that many sites use) or _Last release_ (date of latest version released).


. Click _Search_ and our filtered results will appear.

. To further evaluate a module, click its title in the list of search results
to visit its project page.

When evaluating modules there are a few important aspects to pay attention on these project pages.

* Project description: The description of the module on its project page should
be clear and useful. You should get an idea of its features and requirements.

* Maintenance status: If a module is _Actively maintained_, you can be sure that
there will be security updates, bug fixes and feature improvements provided on
a regular basis. However, if the module is unmaintained or abandoned, you
shouldn't use it.

* Development status: _Under active development_ means you can expect new
features to be added to the project, but some aspects (for example, API) may
still change. _Maintenance fixes only_ means that the project is considered
feature complete.

* Reported installs, downloads: You can see how many people have downloaded and
how many sites use the module. If it's only used by a few sites, it might be a
unique solution that not many people need, or it might be a warning sign that
you shouldn't use it either.

* Maintainers: When was the last commit (the last time someone updated something
on the module) or last release (new version)? If the project has few open
issues, a long time since commits/releases might be appropriate, but if it has
a lot of open issues and there are no commits/releases, that would be a clue
that it might be abandoned.

* Issues: See if there are any open issues, potential problems with the
module. Check the _Statistics_ to see how regularly issues are responded to.

* Resources: Check if the module has documentation or a README file, that can
help you install, configure, explore, and test it.

(Slide/Recap)
In this tutorial we:

- Took a look at the module search form, and learned how to use it to find the type of modules we're interested in.
- We also examined a project page and walked through the important aspects to consider when evaluating a potential module for your site.
