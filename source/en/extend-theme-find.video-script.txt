=== Finding Themes

(Slide/Intro)
How to use filters to search themes and evaluate them.

(Slide/Goal)
Find and evaluate themes on _Drupal.org_.

(Slide/Prerequisites)
- Concept: Drupal as a Content Management System
- Concept: Themes

If you need help with any of these prerequisites consult the written version of this tutorial for links.

(Demo/Browser)

. Go to https://www.drupal.org, and navigate to _Download & Extend > Themes_
(https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme).

. Filter your search using the categories on the theme search page.
For example, you might use the filters:

- How actively is the theme maintained? If a theme is actively maintained, you can expect bug fixes and improvements on a regular basis. Let's choose "Actively maintained".
- What kind of development is the theme undergoing? If you select _Under active development_, you can expect new features to be added, and some aspects may still change. If you select _Maintenance fixes only_, it means that the theme is considered complete. We'll choose Any for this example.
- The Drupal version the theme is compatible with. We'll go with 8.x here.
- Next is Project status. _Sandbox projects_ are experimental projects. _Full projects_ have already gone through an approval process, but they can still be in development. We're interested in Full projects.
- Search by the theme's description.
- You can choose to order your search results by criteria like _Most installed_ (popular themes that many sites use) or _Last release_ (date of latest version released). We'll use 'most installed' here.

. Click _Search_. Search results will appear.

. To further evaluate a theme, click its title in the list of search results
to visit its project page.

Some aspects to pay attention to while evaluating themes:

* Introduction: The description of the theme on its project page should be clear
and useful. A screenshot of the theme helps your evaluation as well.

* Downloads: The theme should be available for your version of the core
software. Pay attention to the color-coding: Themes marked green are
recommended to be used on live sites, the ones marked yellow should be
carefully evaluated before use, and the ones marked red are only
recommended for testing.

* Project Information: Check the theme's maintenance and development status, and
how frequently it's downloaded and installed.

* Issues: See if there are any open issues or potential problems with the theme.

* Resources: Check if the theme has documentation.

(Slide/Recap)
In this tutorial we learned how to locate themes, and how to use the various types of filters that enable us to refine our search.
