==== Goal

Uninstall the core Search and History modules, as well as the core Activity
Tracker module if you installed it in <<config-install>>, to reduce overhead.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

<<understanding-modules>>

==== Site prerequisites

* You must have at least one unused module on your site that you want to
uninstall, such as the core Search module.

* If you want to use Drush to uninstall modules, Drush must be installed. See
<<install-tools>>.

==== Steps

You can use the administrative interface or Drush to uninstall modules.

===== Using the administrative interface

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Extend_ > _Uninstall_ tab
(_admin/modules/uninstall_) wherein you should find the list of modules that are
ready to be uninstalled.

. Check the boxes for the modules you are uninstalling (_Search_, _History_, and
_Activity Tracker_) and click _Uninstall_ at the bottom of the page, as
demonstrated in the following screenshot:

//Login to your Drupal 8 site as an administrator and in the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Extend_ > _Uninstall_ tab.

[NOTE]
=================
If a module that you intend to uninstall is required by some other module(s)
and/or functionality, you will have the checkbox disabled; restricting you to
uninstall it. For instance, _File_ module is required by _Text Editor_,
_CKEditor_, and _Image_. Hence it can't be uninstalled unless you install its
dependent module(s) and functionality.

. Step 2 will prompt you to confirm the module uninstall request wherein click
_Uninstall_, as demonstrated in the following screenshot:

//Login to your Drupal 8 site as an administrator; then in the _Manage_
//administrative menu, navigate to _Extend_ > _Uninstall_ tab, select _search_
//module, and click _Uninstall_.

===== Using Drush

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Extend_
(_admin/modules_). The _Extend_ page appears showing all the available modules
in your site.

. Find the machine name of the module you want to uninstall, by expanding the
information area for the module. For instance, the core Activity Tracker
module's machine name is _tracker_.

. Run the following Drush command to uninstall the module:
+
----
drush pm-uninstall tracker
----

==== Follow-on tasks

* <<install-tools>>

* <<prevent-cache-clear>>

* You can also uninstall the _Comment_ module by following these steps, but only
after comment fields have been removed, which is a side effect of
<<structure-content-type-delete>>.
