=== Uninstalling Unused Modules

(((Modules,uninstalling)))


==== Goal

Leaving the modules installed that are unused by your Drupal application (in our
case, modules such as _Comment_, _History_, and _Search_) adds an overhead to
the site performance. Thus, it is important to identify such modules and
uninstall them. In this guide, you will learn how to uninstall such modules
using Drush as well as site administer UI interface.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<understanding-modules>>

==== Site prerequisites

We assume that Drush 8.x version has been installed on your server and is up and
running. If not installed yet, we recommend you to refer the guide at
<<install-tools>>.

==== Steps

Following are the steps you should perform when you intend to use *Drupal
interface* to uninstall one or more modules:

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Extend_ > _Uninstall_ tab
  (admin/modules/uninstall) wherein you should find the list of modules that are
  ready to be uninstalled.

. Enable the checkbox corresponding to one or more modules you wish to disable
  (e.g., _Search_ module), and click the _Uninstall_ button at the bottom of the
  page, as demonstrated in the following screenshot:

//Login to your Drupal 8 site as an administrator and in the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Extend_ > _Uninstall_ tab.

[NOTE]
=================
If a module that you intend to uninstall is required by some other module(s)
and/or functionality, you will have the checkbox disabled; restricting you to
uninstall it. For instance, _File_ module is required by _Text Editor_,
_CKEditor_, and _Image_. Hence it can't be uninstalled unless you install it's
dependent module(s) and functionality.

. Step 2 will prompt you to confirm the module uninstall request wherein click
  on the _Uninstall_ button, as demonstrated in the following screenshot:

//Login to your Drupal 8 site as an administrator; then in the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Extend_ > _Uninstall_ tab, select _search_ module, and click the _Uninstall_ button.

If you intent to use *Drush* to perform module uninstallation process, follow
the below steps:

. Open the Drush command line window and navigate to the base directory of your
  Drupal application.

. Run the following Drush command to initiate the uninstall request (for
  instance, _search_ module):

----
drush pm-uninstall search
----

==== Follow-on tasks

* We also *recommend* you to follow the discussed guidelines in order to
  uninstall other modules such as _Comment_ and _History_ that are not required
  in the site.
