==== What is a view?

A _view_ is a listing of content on our website. To take some examples from
our farmers market project, the following listings will be implemented as views:

- The list of all vendors
- The list of recipes

_Views_ provide a way for us to output a listing of content from
the system. We can then display this listing in various ways.

The system allows us define _Content Entities_ which allow us to enter
structured data _into_ the system. When we define _views_, we are interested in
the other direction - getting data _out_ and displaying it to the user.

==== What types of data can be displayed using views?

_Views_ can be used to output practically any _Content Entity_ that is stored in
the system. For example, you can create:

* Lists of the most recent content on the site
* Lists of the users on the site

==== What are the various ways the data can be output using views?

A listing created by _Views_ can be in the form of a page containing a table
with sortable fields, or a page with a grid, or a page containing _teasers_ or
pictures which link to respective articles.

However, _views_ can also provide data in the form of blocks, JSON output, RSS
feeds, calendars, on-screen slideshows, and much more.
