==== How can you connect with the community?

The Drupal project has a world-wide community of developers and users. One of
the best ways to improve your knowledge of the platform is to connect with
others that are using it, and get involved in the open-source community. There
are many ways that you can get started:

Attend an event::
  There are both regional and international Drupal events held around the
  world. See the https://www.drupal.org/drupalcon[DrupalCon page] to find
  international events, and the https://groups.drupal.org/events[Event calendar]
  or http://www.drupical.com/[drupical] to find regional events.
Join a local group::
  There are Drupal user groups all around the world. Many of them have regular
  meetings, which you can attend to learn more about Drupal and connect to other
  Drupal users. Find local user groups on the
  https://groups.drupal.org/[Drupal Groups web site].
Participate in a topical or language group::
  There are also interest groups for a wide range of topics, which have on-line
  discussion forums. Find topical groups on the
  https://groups.drupal.org/[Drupal Groups web site]. Many languages have
  their own web sites too; you can find them on the
  https://www.drupal.org/language-specific-communities[Language-specific
  communities] page.
Chat online::
  The Drupal project uses IRC for on-line chatting. There are regional, topical,
  and general-purpose chat groups available. Find out more on the
  https://www.drupal.org/irc[IRC information page].
Report a problem::
  See below.
Contribute::
  You can contribute your time and expertise to the community in many ways, such
  as:
  * https://www.drupal.org/contribute/development[Developing modules or themes],
    or improving them (using the issue queues for existing projects).
  * https://localize.drupal.org[Translating the user interface text]
  * https://www.drupal.org/contribute/documentation[Writing documentation]

==== How can you report a problem or suggest a feature?

Each project within the community (such as the Drupal Core project for the base
software, and projects for each contributed theme and module) uses _issues_ to
keep track of software bugs and plans for new features. You can participate by
creating a bug report when you find a problem, creating a feature request, or
commenting on existing issues. Be sure to search before creating an issue, to
make sure that the problem or feature has not already been reported or
requested. See
https://www.drupal.org/issue-queue[Use the issue queue] and
https://www.drupal.org/node/314185[Reporting a problem] for
more information.

If you find a problem that you believe is related to security, such as a
cross-site scripting vulnerability, do not report it in the standard issue
queue. Instead, report it to the security team. See
https://www.drupal.org/node/101494[How to report a security issue] for details.
