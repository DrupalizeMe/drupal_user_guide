==== Goal

Synchronize the configuration between a development and live site.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<install-prepare>>
* <<install-dev-sites>>
* <<install-dev-making>>

==== Site prerequisites

* You must have a development copy of your production site. See
<<install-dev-making>>.

* The core Configuration Manager module must be installed on both the
development and production sites. See <<config-install>> for instructions on how
to install core modules.

* You must have changed configuration on either the production or development
site (the _source site_), and want to synchronize the changes to the other site
(the _destination site_). As an example, you can develop a new content type,
fields, and views on your development site, and when it is all working
correctly, deploy the changes to the live site.

* All configuration that should not be synchronized between the source and
destination sites must be stored in configuration overrides in the
_settings.php_ file rather than in the database. See <<install-dev-making>>.

==== Steps

. In the source site, in the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to
_Configuration_ > _Development_ > _Configuration synchronization_ > _Export_
(_admin/config/development/configuration/full/export_).

. Click _Export_. Your site will generate an archive of the full site
configuration. Save the file on your local computer.

. In the destination site, in the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to
_Configuration_ > _Development_ > _Configuration synchronization_ > _Import_
(_admin/config/development/configuration/full/import_).

. Browse to find the downloaded configuration archive, and click _Upload_. Your
configuration archive will be uploaded to the destination site, and you will be
redirected to the configuration _Synchronize_ page
(_admin/config/development/configuration_) with a message saying your files were
uploaded.

. Verify that the differences shown on the page are what you expect. You may see
configuration items that have been added, deleted, or changed; for changed
items, you can click _View differences_ to see what the changes are.

. When you are satisfied, click _Import all_ to import the configuration
changes.

==== Expand your understanding

* If the changes you have made involve only one configuration item (such as one
view), you can use the single configuration export/import feature to deploy
the change between sites. See <<extend-deploy>>.

* After the step where you export the full configuration from the source site,
you might also want to unpack the archive and commit it to a version control
system, such as Git, to track changes in your site configuration. See
<<install-tools>>.
