The images in this directory are mostly automated screen captures, generated by
software in the auto_screenshots directory of this project. More information is
in a README.txt file in that directory.

A few images could not be generated by automatic screen capture. These were
generated manually, and their copyright attribution is listed in the
attributions.txt file in the directory above (with the topics they are featured
in). Here is a list of the manually-generated images (in order by topic
appearance in the guide):
