The images in this directory are mostly automated screen captures, generated by
software in the auto_screenshots directory of this project. More information is
in a README.txt file in that directory.

NON-AUTOMATED IMAGES

A few images could not be generated by automatic screen capture. Here is a list
of the manually-generated images (in order by topic appearance in the guide):

Cover image: coverimg.png -- the SVG source for this image is in the "assets"
directory of this project and is called coverimage.svg. You will need to edit
that file, translate the text "User Guide", then export to PNG.

Running the installer (topic install-run.txt): You will need to run the standard
installer, choosing your language, entering values for the Farmers Market web
site, and take a screenshot of each step. Images:
- install-run-1.png -- Select language
- install-run-2.png -- Select profile (Standard)
- install-run-3.png -- Database
- install-run-4.png -- Installation in progress
- install-run-5.png -- Site configuration
- install-run-6.png -- Site installed configuration

Screen shot of vertical toolbar menu configuration (topic config-overview.txt).
To make this screenshot, install Drupal in your language using the Standard
installation profile, log in as an administrator, change the Toolbar to vertical
alignment, expand the Reports section, and take a screenshot of the vertical
toolbar menu. Trim it down to 228x540 pixels:
- config-overview-vertical-menu.png

Screen shot of "pencils" (topic config-overview.txt). To make this screenshot,
install Drupal in your language using the Standard installation profile, with
the site name and slogan set to farmer's market values from the scenario. Log in
as an administrator, go to the Home page, and click the Edit (pencil icon)
button in the upper right corner of the Toolbar. This should turn on all of the
contextual link pencils on the page. Take a screenshot of most or all of the
screen, including the toolbar at the top:
- config-overview-pencils.png

Editing with the In-Place Editor (topic content-in-place-edit.txt). To make
these screenshots, install Drupal with the Standard install profile, and create
an About page with text translated from the English version. Follow the
instructions in the topic to enable in-place editing, and take similar
screenshots.

ENGLISH-ONLY IMAGES

A few images are English-only, and should be copied directly from the English
version rather than regenerated. (Most of them are from drupal.org pages.) Here
is a list:

- extend-manual-install-directories.png : A manually-generated image that shows
  the directory structure of "contrib" and "custom" directories under "modules"
- extend-manual-install-download.png: Shot from drupal.org

- extend-module-find_module_finder.png: Shot from drupal.org
- extend-module-find_project_info.png : Shot from drupal.org
- extend-module-find_search_results.png : Shot from drupal.org

- extend-module-install_download.png : Shot from drupal.org

- extend-theme-find_theme_finder.png : Shot from drupal.org

- extend-theme-install-download.png_ : Shot from drupal.org

- install-prepare-downloads.png : Shot from drupal.org. This is a
  manually-generated screenshot of the section of the Download & Extend page
  on drupal.org that has the "Download Drupal 8...." button on it. We used
  to be able to generate it automatically, but drupal.org markup changed and
  it no longer works.
