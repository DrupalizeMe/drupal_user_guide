=== Setting Up a Taxonomy

(((Taxonomy, create)))

==== Goal

Create an _Ingredients_ vocabulary and add it to the _Recipe_ content type as
a field that can contain an unlimited number of values and that allows adding
new terms to the vocabulary.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<planning-data-types>>
* <<structure-taxonomy>>
* <<structure-fields>>

==== Site prerequisites

You must have a Recipe content type created. See <<structure-content-type>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Structure_ > _Taxonomy_
(_admin/structure/taxonomy_). You will see a list of any vocabularies that
already exist on your site. Initially there might be a Tags vocabulary in the
list which is created with a Standard installation.

terms in this vocabulary.

Add term button, add "Butter" in the Name field. and save. Once you save the
Butter term record the screen will clear and you can continue to add more terms
at this point; for example, "Eggs" and "Milk".

[start=8]
. Edit the detail settings for this field. Since this field is a taxonomy
reference data type we can select what taxonomy will be referenced. We will
also make sure to check the box that allows new ingredients to be added as
recipes are created. These setting are in the Reference Type section on the
form.

==== Follow-on tasks

Add content of type Recipe, using this field (see <<content-create>>). As you
type, matching ingredient terms will be displayed. New terms not already
existing will be added to the Ingredients taxonomy automatically.
