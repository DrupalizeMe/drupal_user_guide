==== What methods are available for downloading the core software?

Before you can build a site, you will need to first download the core software.
Depending on your plans, there are several ways that you can download the core
software:

Try a free online demo::
  If you are evaluating whether or not to use Drupal to build a site, you
  can use an online provider to get a demo installation of the core software in
  20 minutes or less. See the
  https://www.drupal.org/try-drupal[_Drupal.org_ page "Try Drupal"].

Use a one-click installer from your hosting provider::
  If you choose to install the core software at your hosting provider, your
  hosting provider may have specific documentation and/or a one-click install
  that you can use. See
  https://www.drupal.org/association/supporters/hosting[_Drupal.org's_ list of hosting providers that support Drupal].

Use a pre-configured environment::
  Use a pre-configured environment or virtual machine that contains Drupal and
  all the required supporting software to install Drupal locally. See the
  section for your operating system under
  https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/local-server-setup[Drupal.org's Local server setup guide]
  for possible options.

Download manually from the web site::
  If you plan to build a site without add-on modules that have complicated
  dependencies, you can download the core software, or a distribution that
  contains the core software and additional modules or themes, from the web
  site. See <<install-manual>> for instructions.

Use Composer::
  If you plan to use the Drush tool (see <<install-tools>>), or if you are
  building a site that might use modules with complicated dependencies, you
  should use Composer to download the core software, because Composer will
  manage the dependencies properly. If you start your site by downloading
  manually, however, you can convert to using Composer to manage dependencies
  later. See <<install-composer>> for downloading and conversion instructions.

==== What happens when I install the core software?

_Installing_ the core software means setting up some database tables,
configuration, and an administrative user account, so that you can build and use
your site.

==== What methods are available for installing the core software?

There are several ways to install the core software:

Behind-the-scenes installer::
  If you choose to use an online demo or one-click installer from a hosting
  provider, the core software may be installed for you automatically.

Interactive installer::
  The core software has an interactive installer that presents you with several
  on-line forms, and then completes the installation using the information you
  provide in the forms. See <<install-prepare>> and <<install-run>>.

Demo site installer::
  If you download the core software to your local computer, you can quickly
  create a temporary demo site that uses the built-in web server and SQLite
  database that are part of PHP. The command to set up a demo site is given at
  the end of <<install-manual>>. In this case, you will not run the interactive
  installer.

Command-line tool::
  Command-line tools (see <<install-tools>>) can also be used to perform the
  installation steps.
