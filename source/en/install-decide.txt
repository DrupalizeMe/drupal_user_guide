==== What methods are available for downloading the core software?

Before you can build a site, you will need to first download the core software,
and then run the installer. Depending on your plans, there are several ways that
you can download the core software:

Try a free online demo::
  If you are evaluating whether or not to use Drupal to build a site, you
  can use an online provider to get a demo installation of the core software in
  20 minutes or less. See the
  https://www.drupal.org/try-drupal[_Drupal.org_ page "Try Drupal"].

Use a one-click installer from your hosting provider::
  If you choose to install the core software at your hosting provider, your
  hosting provider may have specific documentation and/or a one-click install
  that you can use. See
  https://www.drupal.org/association/supporters/hosting[_Drupal.org's_ list of hosting providers that support Drupal].

Use a pre-configured environment::
  Use a pre-configured environment or virtual machine that contains Drupal and
  all the required supporting software to install Drupal locally. See the
  section for your operating system under
  https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/local-server-setup[Drupal.org's Local server setup guide]
  for possible options.

Use Composer::
  If you plan to use the Drush tool (see <<install-tools>>), or if you are
  building a site that might use modules with complicated dependencies, you
  should use Composer to download the core software, because Composer will
  manage the dependencies properly. See <<install-composer>> for instructions.

Download manually from the web site::
  You can download the core software, or a distribution that contains the core
  software and additional modules or themes, from the web site. See
  <<install-manual>> for instructions.

Use Git::
  It is possible to download a development version of the core files using Git,
  although you will then need to use Composer to download additional
  libraries. See <<install-composer>> for instructions.
