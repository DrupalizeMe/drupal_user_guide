==== What is a reference field?

A _reference field_ is a field that represents a relationship between an entity
and one or more other entities, which may belong to the same or different entity
type. The three most commonly-used reference fields are:

Content reference::
  A reference to a content item. For example, you might want to connect recipes
  to the vendors who submitted them. You would set up a content reference field
  called Submitted by referencing Vendor content items on the Recipe content
  type.

Taxonomy term reference::
  A reference to a taxonomy term. For example, you might want to connect recipes
  to their ingredients. You would set up a taxonomy term reference field called
  Ingredients on the Recipe content type. This reference field will point to the
  vocabulary Ingredients.

User reference::
  A reference to a user account. For example, you might want to connect recipes
  with their chefs. You would set up a user reference field called Chefs on the
  Recipe content type.
