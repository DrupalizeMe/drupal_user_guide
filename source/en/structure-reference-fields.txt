==== What is a reference field?

It is a field that represents a relationship between an entity and one or more
other entities, which may belong to either the same entity type or a different
type. The three most commonly-used types are:

Content reference::
  It provides a robust adds-on to entities that allows you to reference one or
  more content items from another content item.
  For example, you may want to display the vendor name (Submitted by
  field in this case) against each of the recipes. This is where content
  reference comes into action wherein you create Submitted by as the content
  reference field that references to the content items that belong to Vendor
  entity type.

Taxonomy term reference::
  Taxonomy term reference field allows you to reference one or more vocabulary
  terms from any of the intended content items.
  For instance, you may want to categorize your recipe contents based on
  Ingredients that have been used for its preparation. In such scenario, you
  need to create a taxonomy reference field that points to the vocabulary
  Ingredients wherein you are allowed to associate your recipe content with
  one or more taxonomy terms limited to the stated vocabulary.

User reference::
  User reference field enables you to reference the associated user accounts to
  the contents of a specific content type.
  For instance, you may want to associate a recipe with one or more chefs who
  gets credit for the delicious preparation. In such scenarios, you reference
  these chefs' user accounts to the respective recipes.
