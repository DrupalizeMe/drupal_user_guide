=== Introduction to Drupal

(((Content Management System)))

Drupal is a <<glossary-cms,Content Management System (CMS)>>. Generically, a CMS
is software for managing a web site, with these features:

* Content and configuration are stored in a database, so you can edit content
  and manage menus, navigation, and other site aspects on the web.
* Web pages are generated by scripts from information in the database, not
  stored as individual files (although pages may be built and cached in files).
* You can enter information once, and display it in different ways on different
  pages (lists, grids, calendars, etc.).
* Content is (ideally) separate from style and presentation, so style is
  consistent across the site.
* A permission system permits different users to have permission to do different
  actions on the site (administrators, content editors, etc.).

(((LAMP stack)))

Drupal normally runs on a "LAMP" platform:

* L = Linux  operating system, but it can also run on Windows and Mac.
* A = Apache web server, but it can also run on other web servers, such as
  Microsoft IIS.
* M = MySQL database, but it can also run on PostgreSQL, SQLite, and other
  database systems.
* P = PHP scripting language.

(((Open-source software)))
(((GNU public license)))

Drupal is _Free, Open Source Software_ (FOSS), developed by a world-wide
community of developers who donate their time to the project. It is licensed
under the GNU Public License, which offers users the freedom to see and modify
the source code for their own purposes. The Drupal core software can be extended
by _modules_ and its display can be modified by _themes_; thousands of add-on
modules and themes are available for Drupal for free download under the same
license. In addition, there are many _distributions_ available, which provide a
set of modules and/or themes that can be installed together.
