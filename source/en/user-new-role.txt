=== Creating a Role

(((User role,creating)))

==== Goal

Create a _Vendor_ role to allow some - but not all - users to perform specific
tasks.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

<<user-concept>>

// ==== Site prerequisites

==== Steps

Create a Vendor role that you can assign to users in order to give them certain
permissions.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _People_ > _Roles_
(admin/people/roles).

. Once there, you will find the three default roles of "Anonymous user",
"Authenticated user", and "Administrator" along with a button _+Add role_
allowing the creation of a new custom role.
+
// Go to /admin/people/roles and take a screenshot of the page image.

. Click _Add Role_ above the list of roles.

. Name the new role. For this example, enter *Vendor* in the _Role name_ text
box and press _Save_.
+
// Go to /admin/people/roles/add and type the word Vendor in the text field.

[start=5]
. You should see the message "Role Vendor has been added." displayed at the top
of the page.
+
// Add the Vendor role and take a screenshot of the roles page with the success
// message.

You have now created a new user Role called Vendor.
