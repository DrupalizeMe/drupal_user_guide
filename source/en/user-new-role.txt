=== Creating a Role

(((User roles,creating)))

==== Goal

By creating a Vendor role you can give a certain group of users permissions to
perform tasks (for example creating Recipes) in the website.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

// ==== Site prerequisites

==== Steps

Create a Vendor role that you can assign to users in order to give them certain
permissions.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _People_ > _Roles_
  (admin/people/roles).

. Once there, you will find the three default roles of "Anonymous user",
  "Authenticated user", and "Administrator" along with a button _+Add role_
  allowing the creation of a new custom role.

// Go to /admin/people/roles and take a screenshot of the page image.

. Click on the _+Add Role_ button above the list of roles.

[start=4]
. Name the new role. For this example, enter *Vendor* in the _Role name_ text
  box and press _Save_.

// Go to /admin/people/roles/add and type the word Vendor in the text field.

[start=5]
. You should see the message "Role Vendor has been added." displayed at the top
  of the page.

// Add the Vendor role and take a screenshot of the roles page with the success
// message.

You have now created a new user Role called Vendor.
