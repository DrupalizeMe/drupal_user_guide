==== Steps

Create a Vendor role that you can assign to users in order to give them certain
permissions.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _People_ > _Roles_
(_admin/people/roles_).

. Once there, you will find the three default roles of "Anonymous user",
"Authenticated user", and "Administrator" along with a button _Add role_
allowing the creation of a new custom role.

// Roles page (admin/people/roles).

. Click _Add Role_ above the list of roles.

. Name the new role. For this example, enter Vendor in the _Role name_ text
box and click _Save_.

// Add role page (admin/people/roles/add).

of the page.
