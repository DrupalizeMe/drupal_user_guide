* <<user-new-user>>
* <<user-new-role>>
* <<user-concept>>

==== Site prerequisites

The user account that you want to update, and the role you want it to have, must
already exist.

==== Steps

===== Updating the roles using single-user editing method

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _People_
(admin/people).

. Locate the user name of the account you want to update in the list. If it is
not immediately visible, use the _Name or email contains_ filter, or other
filters, to narrow down the list.

.  Click the _Edit_ link in the row of the user account you want to update.

===== Updating the roles using bulk editing method

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _People_
(admin/people).

. Locate the names of all of the user accounts you want to update, and select
them using the checkboxes. If they are
not immediately visible, use the _Name or email contains_ filter, or other
filters, to narrow down the list.

. In the _With selection_ select box, find the desired update. For example, you
might select _Add the Vendor role to the selected users_, or _Remove the
Administrator role from the selected users_.
