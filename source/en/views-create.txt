(((View,creating)))
(((Content list,creating)))
(((List,creating)))

==== Goal

Create a page that lists all the vendors and that will be automatically updated
once a new vendor is added on the site.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<views-concept>>
* <<views-parts>>

==== Site prerequisites

* The _Views_ module is enabled on the site.

* The content type _Vendor_ has been created and it has the URL and Image fields
added. See: <<structure-content-type>> and <<structure-fields>>.

* <<structure-image-style-create, The image style _Medium_ has been created>>.
This style is created when the Image module is installed for the first time,
but if it has been deleted for some reason, you can recreate it.

* A couple of _Vendor_   content items has been created. See:
<<content-create>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Structure_ > _Views_ > _+Add
a new view_ (admin/structure/views/add). The _Add new view_ wizard appears.
