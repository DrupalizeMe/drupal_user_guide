==== Goal

Create a page that lists all the vendors and that will be automatically updated
once a new vendor is added on the site.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<views-concept>>
* <<views-parts>>

==== Site prerequisites

* The _Views_ module must be installed. This is installed for you when you
install with the core Standard installation profile.

* The _Vendor_ content type must exist, with URL and Main Image fields, and your
site must have a couple of Vendor content items. See <<structure-content-type>>,
<<structure-fields>>, and <<content-create>>.

* The _Medium (220x220)_ image style must be defined. This is created on your
site when you install the core Image module, which is installed for you when you
install with the core Standard installation profile, but can be recreated if it
is deleted. See <<structure-image-style-create>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Structure_ > _Views_ > _+Add
a new view_ (_admin/structure/views/add_). The _Add new view_ wizard appears.
