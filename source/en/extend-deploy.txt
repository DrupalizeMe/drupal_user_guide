==== Goal

Copy a view that you have created in a local development site to the production
site.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<install-dev-making>>
* <<extend-config-versions>>
* <<install-dev-sites>>

==== Site prerequisites

* The module _Configuration Manager_ is installed in the local development
site and the production site. See <<config-install>> for instructions on
installing Core modules.

* <<structure-content-type, Have the _Vendor_ content type created>> in
the local development site and the production site.

* <<views-create, Have the _Vendors_ view created>> in the local development
site but not the production site.

==== Steps

. Open the local development site

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Configuration_ >
_Development_ > _Configuration synchronization_ > _Export_ > _Single item_.
(_admin/config/development/configuration/single/export_).
The _Single export_ page appears.

. Select _View_ from the _Configuration type_ list.

. Select _Vendors_ from the _Configuration name_ list. The configuration
appears in the textarea.

. Copy the configuration from the textarea.

// To create this image, create a view called vendors and go to
// admin/config/development/configuration/single/export. Choose View and
// Vendors as explained above

. Open the production site.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Configuration_ >
_Development_ > _Configuration synchronization_ _Import_ > _Single_
(_admin/config/development/configuration_). The _Import_ page appears.

. Select _View_ from the _Configuration type_ list.

. Paste the configuration in the textarea.

. Click _Import_. The confirmation page appears.

. Click _Confirm_.

. Verify that the new view is being created by navigating in the _Manage_
administrative menu to _Structure_ > _Views_.

==== Follow-on tasks

The steps in this topic show how to export and import a single configuration
item. However, often if you develop functionality on a development website
and want to transfer it to your production site, you will need to transfer
multiple configuration items. For instance, if you developed a new content
type with fields, you would need to transfer several configuration items for
each field, one for the content type itself, and possibly multiple view mode
and form mode items, and they would have to be transferred in the right order.
Getting this right can be both tedious and difficult.

As an alternative you can export and import the complete configuration of the
site. For this you would need a local development site which is a clone
of the production site. See <<install-dev-making>>.

Finally you could use the contributed
https://www.drupal.org/project/features[Features module from _Drupal.org_] that allows
exporting and importing bundled functionality (for example, all the
configuration for a photo gallery).
