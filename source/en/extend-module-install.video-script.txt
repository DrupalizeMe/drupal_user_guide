=== Downloading and Installing a Module from _Drupal.org_

(Slide/Intro)
How to download and install a module from Drupal.org (using the user interface) or by using Drush.


(Slide/Goal)

Download and install the
https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_toolbar[contributed Admin Toolbar module],
which allows you to easily browse through the administration section of the
website.

(Slide/Prerequisites)
- Concept: “Modules”
- Concept: “Additional Tools”
- Finding Modules

If you need help with any of these prerequisites consult the written version of this tutorial for links.

(Demo/Browser)

* If you want to install modules via your website, the core Update Manager module
must be installed.

* If you want to use Drush, Drush must be installed.

If you need help with either of these steps refer to the written version of this tutorial.

==== Steps

You can use the administrative interface or Drush to install a contributed
module. If you are installing a custom module rather than a contributed module,
if you see a message saying _Installing modules and themes requires FTP access
to your server_, or if the steps below do not work to download and unpack the
module files, follow the steps in the Manually installing a module or theme tutorial.

If you are installing a contributed module with external dependencies that are managed by Composer, follow the steps for downloading in the Using Composer tutorial.

First we're going to look at using the administrative interface.

. On the _Admin toolbar_ project page on drupal.org
(_https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_toolbar_), scroll to the _Downloads_
section at the bottom of the page.

. Copy the address of the _tar.gz_ link. Depending on your device and browser,
you might do this by right clicking and selecting _Copy link address_.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Extend_
(_admin/modules_).

. Click _Install new module_. The _Install new module_ page appears.

. In the field _Install from a URL_, paste the copied download link. This value
could look like this:
_https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/admin_toolbar-8.x-1.14.tar.gz_

. Click _Install_ to upload and unpack the new module on the server. The files
are being downloaded to the _modules_ directory.

. Click _Enable newly added modules_ to return to the _Extend_ page. If you
used the manual uploading procedure, you'll be starting with this step, and reach the
_Extend_ page by using the _Manage_ administrative menu and navigating to
_Extend_ (_admin/modules_).

. Locate and check _Admin toolbar_.

. Click _Install_ to turn on the new module.

===== Using Drush

. Find the project name for the module you want to install, which is the last
segment of the module's project page URL. For example, if the project URL is
_https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_toolbar_, the project name is
"admin_toolbar".

. Run the following Drush commands, giving the project name (for example,
`admin_toolbar`) as a parameter. The first command downloads the module, and the second one enables it.

drush dl admin_toolbar
drush en admin_toolbar
