//==== Prerequisite knowledge

==== What is a Content Management System?

A content management system (CMS) is a software tool that lets users add,
publish, edit, or remove content from a website, using a web browser on a
smartphone, tablet, or desktop computer. Typically the CMS software is written
in a scripting language, and its scripts run on a computer where a database and
a web server are installed. The content and settings for the website are usually
stored in a database, and for each page request that comes to the web server,
the scripts combine information from the database and _assets_ (JavaScript
files, CSS files, image files, etc. that are part of the CMS or have been
uploaded) to build the pages of the website.

The combination of the operating system that the CMS runs on, the scripting
language it is written in, the database it stores its information in, and the
web server that runs the scripts to retrieve information and send it to the
browser is known as the _stack_ that the CMS runs on; the commonly-used
combination of the Linux operating system, Apache web server, MySQL database,
and PHP scripting language is known as the _LAMP stack_.

==== What is Drupal?

Drupal is a flexible CMS based on the LAMP stack, with a modular design allowing
features to be added and removed by installing and uninstalling _modules_, and
allowing the entire look and feel of the website to be changed by installing and
uninstalling _themes_. The base Drupal download, known as Drupal Core, contains
the PHP scripts needed to run the basic CMS functionality, several optional
modules and themes, and many JavaScript, CSS, and image assets. Many additional
modules and themes can be downloaded from the https://www.drupal.org[_Drupal.org_]
website.

Drupal can also run on other technology stacks:

* The operating system can be Windows or MacOS instead of Linux.

* The web server can be Nginix or IIS instead of Apache.

* The database can be PostgreSQL or SQLite instead of MySQL, or a
MySQL-compatible replacement such as MariaDB or Percona.

Other operating systems, web servers, and databases can also be made to work;
however, the scripts that Drupal uses are written in PHP, so that cannot be
changed.
