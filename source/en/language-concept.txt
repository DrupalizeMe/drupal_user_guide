==== What can be translated on your site?

The base language for the software that your site runs (core software,
modules, and theme) is English. However, you can create either a site that
displays in a different language or a multi-lingual site; if you do so, all
relevant text, images, and file attachments should be shown in the appropriate
language for each site visitor. You need to have the core Language
module installed in order to use a language other than English on the site.

There are three types of information that you can translate, each with its own
method for translating:

User interface text::
  Built-in text present in the core software, modules, and themes. This can be
  translated from the base English language of the software into the language(s)
  of your site. Typically, rather than needing to translate this text yourself,
  you can download translations. You need to have the core Interface Translation
  module installed in order to translate this text.
Configuration text::
  Text whose structure and initial values are defined by the core software,
  modules, and theme, but that you can edit. Examples include the
  labels for fields in your content types, header text in views, your site name,
  and the content of automatic email messages that your site sends out. After
  creating configuration text in the default language of your site, you can
  translate it into other languages. You need to have the core Configuration
  Translation module installed in order to translate this text.
Content text and files::
  If your site is multilingual, you can configure the content fields on your
  site to be translatable. After creating content in one language, you can
  translate it into other languages. Fields can contain textual information or
  uploaded files, and for each field on each content type, you can configure it
  to be translatable or non-translatable. You need to have the core Content
  Translation module installed in order to translate this text.
