//==== Site prerequisites


==== Steps

The first time you visit your site you will be automatically presented with the
installer. This is a one time process that will walk you through some basic
configuration necessary to get your site up and running.

. Choose a language using the select list on the first page of the installer.
  We'll use English for our site. You could optionally choose from any of the
  other listed languages. The language files for the chosen language will be
  downloaded and installed so that the rest of the installation process can be
  finished the the chosen language. After choosing a language click _Save and
  continue_.

// Go to the first step of the installer

. Choose an installation profile. Installation profiles provide site features
  and functions for a specific type of site as a single download containing
  Drupal core, contributed modules, themes, and pre-defined configuration. Core
  contains two installation profiles to choose from. Choose the _Standard_
  profile and click _Save and continue_.

. The next step in the installer will verify that your system meets the minimum
  requirements. If it does not, you'll be presented with an outline of what
  needs to be corrected in order to proceed. If it does, the installer will
  automatically advance to the next step.

. Database configuration. Before you can complete this step you'll need to
  create new database on your database server, and then obtain the database name
  username and password. Fill in the correct information for your environment:

  [width="100%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
  |================================
  |Field name | Value
  |Database name | drupal8
  |Database username | databaseUsername
  |Database password | ************
  |================================

// Go to the database configuration step of the installer

  Then click _Save and continue_.

. The next step will display a progress bar under the heading _Installing
  Drupal_. After the installer has completed it will automatically advance to
  the next step.

// Go to the page displaying the installation progress bar

. The final step is to configure some basic information about your new site.
  Note that the user account you create in this step is the site's admin
  account. See <<user-admin-account>> for important information about this
  unique account. You can safely name this account "admin", and make sure chose
  a secure and unique password.

  Fill in the form with the following information:

  [width="100%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
  |================================
  |Field name | Value
  |Site name | Anytown Farmers Market
  |Site email address | info@example.com
  |Username | admin
  |Password | ************
  |Confirm password | ************
  |Email address | admin@example.com
  |================================

  The remaining fields can likely be left at their default values.

// Go to the basic site information configuration step of the installer

Click the _Save and continue_ button.

. You will be redirected to the front page of your new site and you should see
  the message _Congratulations, you installed Drupal!_ displayed at the top of
  the page.
