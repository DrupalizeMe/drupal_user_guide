=== Configuring Content Translation

(((Content Translation,configuring)))

==== Goal

Customize language settings for available content entities. Make the Basic Page
content type translatable, as well as the Basic Block and the Custom Menu Link
(and their fields).

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<planning-data-types>>
* <<language-concept>>

==== Site prerequisites

Language modules installed. See <<language-enable>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Configuration_ > _Regional
and Language_ > _Content Language and Translation_
(admin/config/regional/content-language): it lists all available content
entity types and lets you configure per sub-type the default language and
language selector visibility.

. In the Custom language settings enable _Content_, _Custom block_ and _Custom
menu link_.

. Configuration options for the enabled items appear: within each entity type,
you can choose (via their drop down) whether the sub-types (for example Article
and Basic Page types of Content) are translatable. You have the option to show
the language selector on the UI, which would let users change from the default
language and also to initialize the default language to a dynamic language or a
specific value. Dynamic possibilities include the site default language at the
time of creation, the current interface language when the content is created or
the preferred language of the user who creates the entity.

. Within each translatable entity sub-type, you can decide which fields should
be translatable. Many of these fields may not be translation dependent (e.g.
Publishing status) in which case it is better to leave them disabled. However,
enabling translation for fields that are numbers or dates has use for
accountability or implementing workflows.
