==== Goal

Download and install a theme from _Drupal.org_.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<extend-theme-find>>
* <<install-tools>>

==== Site prerequisites

Composer must be installed to download themes. If you want to use Drush, Drush
must be installed. See <<install-tools>>.

==== Steps

To install a contributed theme, first download the theme with Composer. Then
install it using either the administrative interface or Drush. If you are
installing a custom theme rather than a contributed theme that is not
available via Composer, skip the steps for downloading the theme, and refer to
<<extend-manual-install>>. Then return here and follow the steps for installing
the theme using either the administrative interface or Drush.

===== Download the contributed theme with Composer

. On the theme's project page on drupal.org (for example,
_https://www.drupal.org/project/honey_), scroll to the _Releases_ section
at the bottom of the page.

. Copy the provided Composer command for the version of the theme you want to
install.

. Alternatively, type the following command (substituting
the short name of the theme and desired version for +honey:^1.0+):
+
----
composer require 'drupal/honey:^1.0'
----

. At the command line, change to the root directory or your project. Paste the
Composer command and execute it.

. You should see a message about the theme being successfully downloaded.

===== Install the theme using the administrative interface

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Appearance_
(_admin/appearance_). The _Appearance_ page appears.

. Locate the new theme under _Uninstalled themes_ and click _Install and set as
default_ to use it. All non-administrative pages on the site will now use this
new theme.

===== Install the theme using Drush

. To install the theme, and set it as the default, run the following Drush\
commands, giving the project name (for example, _honey_) as a parameter:
+
----
drush theme:enable honey
drush config:set system.theme default honey
----

. Follow the instructions on the screen.

==== Expand your understanding

* In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Appearance_
(_admin/appearance_) and uninstall any themes that you are not using.

* <<extend-module-find>>

* <<extend-module-install>>

* If you do not see the effect of these changes in your site, you might need
to clear the cache. See <<prevent-cache-clear>>.
