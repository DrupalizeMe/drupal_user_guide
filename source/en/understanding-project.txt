==== What is Free and Open Source Software?

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is software that is developed by a
community of people, released under a non-commercial license, and whose _source
code_ (the program files that make up the software) is freely available.

==== What is the Drupal project?

The Drupal project is a FOSS project whose purpose is to develop the core Drupal
content management system software, as well as add-on modules, additional
themes, translations, documentation, and special-purpose distributions. The
people who contribute their time and money to the Drupal project come from all
over the world, and form a diverse community that comes together for this common
purpose.

The community encompasses many smaller groups, who form for purposes
such as developing a particular piece of Drupal-related software, writing
documentation, maintaining the security of the Drupal software, translating
Drupal software into a particular language, using Drupal for some specific
purpose, and meeting in person in a particular geographical area.

For more on how you can connect to and communicate with the world-wide
community, see <<thoughts-connecting>> and <<thoughts-support>>.

==== What is the Drupal Association?

The https://assoc.drupal.org[Drupal Association] is a non-profit organization
dedicated to supporting the Drupal project and community. Its main functions
are:
