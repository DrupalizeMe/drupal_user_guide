interface for running the Database Updates script.

(((Module,updating)))
(((Security update,applying)))
(((Contributed module,updating)))

==== Goal

Update a contributed module and run the _Database updates_ script.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<security-concept>>
* <<security-cron-concept>>

==== Site prerequisites

* A contributed module has been installed and there is an update available for
it. See <<extend-module-install>> and <<security-announce>>.

* If your site is live, you should test this process in a development
environment before running it on your production site. See
<<install-dev-making>>.

* You have created a full-site backup. See <<prevent-backups>>.

* If you want to use the user interface to check for updates, the core Update
Manager module must be installed. See <<config-install>> for instructions on
installing core modules.

==== Steps

Before you start, check for module-specific update instructions. Read and
understand all module-specific requirements before proceeding with the updates.
To find instructions, check the module's project page _Read Documentation_ link.

To view further instructions, after downloading the updated files, look for
_README.txt_, _INSTALL.txt_, and _UPGRADE.txt_ that come with the module. Also,
review the release notes on the project page by clicking the version number
you're downloading.

Updating a module requires first putting your site into maintenance mode, then
obtaining the new code files and applying any required database updates, then
finally taking the site out of maintenance mode.

You can update the code for a contributed module using Composer. If you are
updating a custom module rather than a contributed module, obtain the new module
files, then continue with instructions for running the database updates via the
administrative interface below.

This assumes that you are using Composer to manage the files in your site; see
<<install-composer>>.

===== Update a contributed module with Composer

. Put your site in maintenance mode. See <<extend-maintenance>>.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Reports_ >
_Available updates_ > _Update_ (_admin/reports/updates_).

. Find and check the module in the list. Click _Download these updates_ for the
module.

. Determine the short name of the project you want to update. For contributed
modules and themes, it is the last part of the URL of the project page; for
example, the Geofield module, at https://www.drupal.org/project/geofield, has
short name +geofield+.

. If you want to update to the latest stable release, use the following
command, substituting the short name of the project to be updated for
+geofield+:
+
----
composer update drupal/geofield --with-dependencies
----
+
To learn how to download specific versions see <<install-composer>>.

. After obtaining the new module files run any database updates page by typing
the URL _example.com/update.php_ in your browser.

. Click _Continue_ to run the updates. The database update scripts will be
executed.

. Click _Administration pages_ to return to the administration section of your
site.

. Take your site out of maintenance mode. See <<extend-maintenance>>.

. Clear the Drupal cache (refer to <<prevent-cache-clear>>).

==== Expand your understanding

* Review the site log (refer to <<prevent-log>>) once the updates are complete
to check for errors.
