==== What is a Log?

Your site captures system events in a log to be reviewed by an authorized
individual at a later time. The log is simply a list of recorded events
containing usage data, performance data, errors, warnings and operational
information. It is vital to check the log on a regular basis as it is often the
only way to tell what is going on.

You can find your site's _Recent log messages_ in the _Manage_ administrative
menu under _Reports_ (admin/reports/dblog).
