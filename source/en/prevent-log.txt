==== What is a Log?

Your site captures system events in a log to be reviewed by an authorized
individual at a later time. The log is a list of recorded events
containing usage data, performance data, errors, warnings and operational
information. It is vital to check the log on a regular basis as it is often the
only way to tell what is going on.

You can find your site's recent log messages in the _Manage_ administrative menu
by navigating to _Reports_ > _Recent log messages_ (_admin/reports/dblog_).
