==== What are image styles?

Image styles allow you to upload a single image but display it in several
ways; each display variation, or _image style_, is the result of
applying one or more _effects_ to the original image. As an example,
you might upload a high-resolution image with a 4:3 aspect ratio, and
display it scaled down, square cropped, or black-and-white (or any
combination of these effects). Drupal provides a way to do this efficiently:
you configure an image style with the desired effects on the Image styles
page (admin/config/media/image-styles), and the first time a particular image
is requested in that style, the effects are applied. The resulting image is
saved, and the next time that same style is requested, the saved image is
retrieved without the need to recalculate the effects. Drupal core provides
several effects that you can use to define styles; others may be provided by
contributed modules.

Visit the Image styles page via the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to
_Configuration_ > _Media_ > _Image styles_ (admin/config/media/image-styles) to
see the image styles that are defined by default.
