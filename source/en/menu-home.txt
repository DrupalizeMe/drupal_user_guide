(((Front page,configuring)))
(((Home page,configuring)))
(((Configuring,home page)))


==== Goal

Configure which content is displayed as the front page of your website.

//==== Prerequisite knowledge

==== Site prerequisites

The content item that you want to designate as the front page of your site must
exist. See <<content-create>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Configuration_ > _System_ >
_Site information_ (_admin/config/system/site-information_).

. Under the "FRONT PAGE" section, replace "/node" with the name of your page you
would like to make the home page. To use the Home page that was previously
created, type its path "/home" in the field and click _Save configuration_ at
the bottom of the page.

your front page (home page).

==== Follow-on tasks

* <<menu-link-from-content>>

* Follow <<content-create>> to create an error page to be used as a 404 (page
not found) or 403 (not authorized) response on your site. Then following the
steps here, you can designate it as the error response, in the _Error pages_
section of the configuration.
