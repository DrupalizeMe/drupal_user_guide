=== Designating a Front Page for your Site

(((Front page,configuration)))
(((Home page,configuration)))
(((Configuration,front page)))


==== Goal

The goal of this task is to identify specific content (which has already been created) as the front page of our website. The content for the front of a website can be any type of content. For example, a "Basic page" or "Article". For this task we are going to use content that is of the content type "Basic page" and identify it as the site front page content.

==== Steps

. Under "Manage" in the administration menu, select "Configuration".
//To create this image: download Drupal 8.0.0-beta14 and view the site. I captured just the top administration menu (2-levels). Made sure my mouse was hovered over "Configuration" to get the underline

. Under the "System" category, select "Site information".
//To create this image: download Drupal 8.0.0-beta14, select "Configuration" in the administration menu. I captured just the "System" category and sub-items, "Site information" and "Cron".

. Under the "FRONT PAGE" section type the name of your page you would like to make the front. In this example, we have created a node using the Basic page content type with the title of "Home". We will type "/home" in the text field and select the "Save configuration" button at the bottom of the page.
//To create this image: download Drupal 8.0.0-beta14, select "Configuration" under "Manage", then select "Site information". I captured just the "FRONT PAGE" area with "/home" in the text field including empty "ERROR PAGES" text fields and "Save configuration" button

. Congratulations! You have identified content for your front page (home page)!
//To create this image: download Drupal 8.0.0-beta14, follow above steps, making sure to follow all scenario specifications for colors, logo, site name, slogan, etc. I captured the front page after the "home" content had been selected as the front page content.
