(((Front page,configuring)))
(((Home page,configuring)))

Configure which content is displayed as the front page of your website.

//==== Prerequisite knowledge

==== Site prerequisites

<<content-create>>

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Configuration_ > _System_ >
_Site information_ (_admin/config/system/site-information_).

. Under the "FRONT PAGE" section, replace "/node" with the name of your page you
would like to make the front.
+
In this example, we have created a node using the Basic page content type with
the title of "Home". We will type "/home" in the text field and click _Save
configuration_ at the bottom of the page.
