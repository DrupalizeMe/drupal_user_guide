=== Designating a Front Page for your Site

(((Front page,configuration)))
(((Home page,configuration)))
(((Configuration,front page)))


==== Goal

The goal of this task is to identify specific content (which has already been
created) as the front page of our website. The content for the front of a
website can be any type of content. For example, a "Basic page" or
"Article". For this task we are going to use content that is of the content type
"Basic page" and identify it as the site front page content.

//==== Prerequisite knowledge

==== Site prerequisites

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Configuration_ > _System_ >
  _Site information_ (admin/config/system/site-information).

. Under the "FRONT PAGE" section, replace "/node" with the name of your page you would like to make the front.
//To create this image: download Drupal 8.0.0-beta14, select "Configuration" under "Manage", then select "Site information". I captured just the "FRONT PAGE" area with the default, "/node" in the text field

In this example, we have created a node using the Basic page content type with the title of "Home". We will type "/home" in the text field and select the "Save configuration" button at the bottom of the page.

//To create this image: download Drupal 8.0.0-beta14, follow above steps, making sure to follow all scenario specifications for colors, logo, site name, slogan, etc. I captured the front page after the "home" content had been selected as the front page content.
