=== Configuring cron maintenance tasks

(((Automated Cron module,configuring)))
(((Cron,configuring)))

==== Goal

Ensure that cron maintenance tasks are run regularly.  If not, then enable the
_Automated Cron_ module.  Alternatively run cron maintenance tasks from outside
the website.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<security-cron-concept>>

// ==== Site prerequisites

==== Steps

. Review the Status Report (see <<prevent-status>>) to see when cron maintenance
  tasks were last run.
+
If you installed the website using the _Standard_ installation profile (or
similar), then cron maintenance tasks might already be running via the
_Automated Cron_ module.  By default these tasks are run at most every three
hours.

. Choose whether to run cron maintenance tasks using the _Automated Cron_
  module, or by other means.
+
The _Automated Cron_ module may not be suitable for some websites because:

* Cron maintenance tasks will only be run after a page on the website is
  visited. If no one visits the website for a long time, cron maintenance tasks
  will not be run.
* Because cron maintenance tasks are run after the page has been generated,
  there is less time for the tasks to be run before various server timeouts are
  reached (e.g. PHP execution timeout).  If this happens the logs (See
  <<prevent-log>>) will show error messages that cron is unable to complete.
* There is a small https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability[scalability] cost
  to _Automated Cron_ module â€” because cron maintenance tasks are being run by
  the web server, that HTTP connection is occupied until the tasks are complete
  (which may run for several minutes).

[start=3]
. Enable and configure the core _Automated Cron_ module (see
  <<language-enable>> for instructions on installing core modules).
+
Once enabled, and after the website sends a page to the web browser, it will
check how long since cron maintenance tasks have last run, and run them if
necessary.
+
The _Automated Cron_ module can be configured to control how frequently cron
maintenance tasks are run.  In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to
_Configuration_ > _System_ > _Cron_
(admin/config/system/cron).
+

[start=4]
. Run cron maintenance tasks from outside the website.
+
The status report (see above) shows a URL that can be used to
run cron from outside of the website; for example:
_http://www.example.com/cron/0MgWtfB33FYbbQ5UAC3L0LL3RC0PT3RNUBZILLA0Nf1Re_
+
This URL can be used by:
+
  * https://www.drupal.org/node/23714[The Cron daemon] (Linux, OS X, Solaris,
    BSD)
  * https://www.drupal.org/node/31506[Scheduled Tasks] (Windows)
  * A cron SASS provider (software as a service)
  * A cron manager provided by your webhost (see the documentation provided by
    your webhost)
+
If you use one of these methods be sure to disable the _Automated Cron_ module
(see <<config-uninstall>>).
