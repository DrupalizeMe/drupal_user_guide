=== Configuring cron maintenance tasks

(((Automated Cron module,configuring)))
(((Cron task,configuring)))

==== Goal

Check whether cron maintenance tasks are run regularly, and if not, either
install the core Automated Cron module or run cron maintenance tasks from
outside the website.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

<<security-cron-concept>>

// ==== Site prerequisites

==== Steps

. Review the Status Report (see <<prevent-status>>) to see when cron maintenance
tasks were last run.
+
If you installed the website using the core Standard installation profile (or
similar), then cron maintenance tasks might already be running via the
core Automated Cron module.  By default these tasks are run at most every three
hours.

. Choose whether to run cron maintenance tasks using the core Automated Cron
module, or by other means.
+
The core Automated Cron module might not be suitable for some websites because:
+
  * Cron maintenance tasks will be run only after a page on the website is
  visited. If no one visits the website for a long time, cron maintenance tasks
  will not be run.
  * Because cron maintenance tasks are run after the page has been generated,
  there is less time for the tasks to be run before various server timeouts are
  reached (for example, PHP execution timeout). If this happens the logs (See
  <<prevent-log>>) will show error messages that cron is unable to complete.
  * There is a small https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability[scalability] cost
  to the core Automated Cron module -- because cron maintenance tasks are being
  run by the web server, that HTTP connection is occupied until the tasks are
  complete (which may run for several minutes).

. Install and configure the core Automated Cron module (see <<config-install>>
for instructions on installing core modules).
+
Once installed, and after the website sends a page to the web browser, it will
check how long since cron maintenance tasks have last run, and run them if
necessary.
+
The core Automated Cron module can be configured to control how frequently cron
maintenance tasks are run.  In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to
_Configuration_ > _System_ > _Cron_
(_admin/config/system/cron_).

. Run cron maintenance tasks from outside the website.
+
The status report (see above) shows a URL that can be used to
run cron from outside of the website; for example:
_http://www.example.com/cron/0MgWtfB33FYbbQ5UAC3L0LL3RC0PT3RNUBZILLA0Nf1Re_
+
This URL can be used by the following cron schedulers; if you use one of these
methods, uninstall the core Automated Cron module (see <<config-uninstall>>):
+
  * https://www.drupal.org/node/23714[The Cron daemon] (Linux, OS X, Solaris,
  BSD)
  * https://www.drupal.org/node/31506[Scheduled Tasks] (Windows)
  * A cron SASS provider (software as a service)
  * A cron manager provided by your webhost (see the documentation provided by
  your webhost)
