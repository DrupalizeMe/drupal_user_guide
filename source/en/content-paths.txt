==== What is a URL?

URL is an abbreviation of "Uniform Resource Locator" and is the page's address
on the web. It is the "name" by which a browser identifies a page to display. In
the example "Check us out at _example.com_." the part _example.com_ is
the URL for the home page of your website. Users use URLs implicitly to locate
content on the web.

==== What is a Path?

In Drupal terms, a path is the unique, last part of the URL for a specific
function or piece of content. For example, for a page whose full URL is
_http://example.com/node/7_, the path is _node/7_.

Here are some examples of paths you might find in your site:

* _node/7_
* _taxonomy/term/6_
* _admin/content/comment_
* _user/login_
* _user/3_

==== What is an Alias?

The core software has a feature called "URL Alias" that allows you to provide a
more understandable name to the content. So, if you have an "About Us" page with
the path _node/7_, you can set up an alias so that your visitors will see it as
_http://www.example.com/AboutUs_. As far as browsers, servers, and search
engines go, it is totally unnecessary. But for humans, it is nearly
mandatory. This is why most consultants tell people to always turn on the Path
core module, which supports URL aliasing.
