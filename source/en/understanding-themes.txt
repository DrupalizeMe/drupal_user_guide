==== What is a Theme?

A theme is a set of files that define the visual look and feel of your site.
The core Drupal software and modules that run on your site determine which
_content_ (including HTML text and other data stored in the database, uploaded
images, and any other asset files) is displayed on the pages of your site.  The
theme determines the HTML markup and CSS styling that wraps the content.

Drupal provides several basic themes with the core distribution.  These themes
have largely been designed and built by the community over the last several
years and will all be good choices for building your first sites and becoming
more familiar with how Drupal works.

Drupal is a well established CMS so the market for 3rd party themes - both free
and paid - is very robust.  There is <<extend-theme-find,a user guide page that
explains how to find, evaluate, and download themes>> on Drupal.org.

If none of these options suit your needs, you'll need to create a custom theme.
A custom theme can be as simple as a single CSS file that adds styling to the
markup that Drupal provides.  Guidance for creating custom themes in Drupal 8
can be found in the https://www.drupal.org/theme-guide/8[Drupal.org community documentation page "Theming Drupal"].
