Install a core module, or a contributed module whose files have already been
uploaded to the site, through the administrative interface or using Drush.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

<<understanding-modules>>

==== Site prerequisites

If you want to use Drush to install modules, Drush must be installed. See
<<install-tools>>.

==== Steps

You can use the administrative interface or Drush to install modules.

===== Using the administrative interface

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Extend_
(_admin/modules_). The _Extend_ page appears showing all the available modules
in your site.

. Check the boxes for the module or modules you want to install. For example,
check the box for the core Ban module.

. Click _Install_. The checked modules will be installed.

===== Using Drush

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Extend_
(_admin/modules_). The _Extend_ page appears showing all the available modules
in your site.

. Find the machine name of the module you want to install, by expanding the
information area for the module. For instance, the core Ban
module's machine name is _ban_.

. Run the following Drush command to install the module:
+
----
drush pm:enable ban
