=== Clearing the Cache

(Slide/Intro)
This tutorial covers how to clear the cache using Drush or the user interface.

(Slide/Goal)
By the end of this tutorial you'll know how to clear or rebuild your site's internal caches to ensure they are up-to-date with the most recent data, using either the user interface or Drush.

(Silde/Prerequisites)
Before you get started you you should make sure that you:

- Know what Drupals cache is and when you might want to consider rebuilding it
- And if you plan to use Drush you'll need to have it installed already

See the written version of this tutorial for links to each of these prerequisite tutorials.

(Demo/Browser - via the UI)

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to Configuration > Development > Performance.

At the top of the page click the button labeled _Clear all caches_.

This will instruct Drupal to clear and rebuild all of its internal caches. After completing a message saying the cache has been cleared appears at the top of the page.

(Demo/Terminal - Drush)
If you want to use one of two commands:

Use the command `drush cache-rebuild`, or the shorter alias `drush cr`, to clear and rebuild all cached data for a site. After running this command, you will see the output message "Cache rebuild complete."

Alternatively, use the command `drush cc` to see a list of individual caches and then choose the specific cache you would like to clear. Running this command should produce output like the following:

> drush cc
Enter a number to choose which cache to clear.
 [0]  :  Cancel
 [1]  :  drush
 [2]  :  theme-registry
 [3]  :  menu
 [4]  :  css-js
 [5]  :  block
 [6]  :  module-list
 [7]  :  theme-list
 [8]  :  render
 [9]  :  views
----

Choose a cache to clear from the list provided by entering the number associated with that cache, and then press "Enter" to continue.

After running this command you'll see the output message, " .... "

(Slide/Recap)
In this tutorial we looked at how you can clear and rebuild your site's internal cache using either the administrative user interface, or via Drush.
