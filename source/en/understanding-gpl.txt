==== What is Drupal Licensing?

Drupal and all contributed files hosted on Drupal.org are licensed under the GNU
General Public License, version 2 or later. That means you are free to download,
reuse, modify, and distribute any files hosted in Drupal.org's Git repositories
under the terms of either the GPL version 2 or version 3, and to run Drupal in
combination with any code with any license that is compatible with either
versions 2 or 3.

Drupal contributors should follow these guidelines:

* All files (PHP, JavaScript, images, Flash, etc.) hosted on Drupal.org have to
  be under the GPL. If it's in Git, then it is under the same license (GPL
  version 2 or later).
* All Drupal contributors retain copyright on their code, but agree to release
  it under the same license as Drupal.
* Drupal modules and themes are a derivative work of Drupal. If you distribute
  them, you must do so under the terms of the GPL version 2 or later.
* All content on Drupal.org itself is copyrighted by its original contributors,
  and is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license
  2.0.
* Sample code on Drupal.org is also available under the GPL version 2 or later.
