==== What is Drupal Licensing?

Drupal and all contributed files hosted on _Drupal.org_ are licensed under the
GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2 or later. That means you are free to
download, reuse, modify, and distribute any files that are part of a project on
_Drupal.org's_ under the terms of either the GPL version 2 or version 3, and to
run the core software in combination with any code with any license that is
compatible with either versions 2 or 3.

Drupal contributors should follow these guidelines:

* All files (PHP, JavaScript, images, Flash, etc.) that are part of a project
on _Drupal.org_ have to be under the GPL version 2 or later.

* All Drupal contributors retain copyright on their code, but agree to release
it under the same license as Drupal.

* Drupal modules and themes are a derivative work of Drupal. If you distribute
them, you must do so under the terms of the GPL version 2 or later.

* All content on _Drupal.org_ itself is copyrighted by its original contributors,
and is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license
2.0.

* Sample code on _Drupal.org_ is also available under the GPL version 2 or later.
