==== What is Drupal Licensing?

Drupal and all contributed files hosted on _Drupal.org_ are licensed under the GNU
General Public License, version 2 or later. That means you are free to download,
reuse, modify, and distribute any files hosted in _Drupal.org's_ Git repositories
under the terms of either the GPL version 2 or version 3, and to run Drupal in
combination with any code with any license that is compatible with either
versions 2 or 3.

Drupal contributors should follow these guidelines:

* All files (PHP, JavaScript, images, Flash, etc.) hosted on _Drupal.org_ have to
be under the GPL. If it's in Git, then it is under the same license (GPL
version 2 or later).

* All Drupal contributors retain copyright on their code, but agree to release
it under the same license as Drupal.

* Drupal modules and themes are a derivative work of Drupal. If you distribute
them, you must do so under the terms of the GPL version 2 or later.

* All content on _Drupal.org_ itself is copyrighted by its original contributors,
and is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license
2.0.

* Sample code on _Drupal.org_ is also available under the GPL version 2 or later.
