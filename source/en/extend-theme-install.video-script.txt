=== Downloading and Installing a Theme from _Drupal.org_

(Slides/Intro)
How to download and install a theme from Drupal.org or by using Drush.

(Slides/Goal)
Download and install a theme from _Drupal.org_.

(Slide/Prerequisites)
- “Finding Themes”
- Concept: "Additional Tools”

==== Site prerequisites

If you want to install via the website, the core Update Manager module must be
installed. See the written version of this tutorial for links to instructions on installing modules.

If you want to use Drush, it must be installed.

If you need help with any of these prerequisites consult the written version of this tutorial for links.

(Demo/Browser)

You can use the administrative interface or Drush to install a contributed
theme. If you are installing a custom theme rather than a contributed theme, if
you see a message saying _Installing modules and themes requires FTP access to
your server_, or if the steps below do not work to download and unpack the theme
files, follow the steps in the manual installation tutorial. If you are installing a
contributed theme with external dependencies that are managed by Composer,
follow the steps for downloading in the Using Composer tutorial. In either of these
cases, then continue here with the instructions for using the administrative
interface below.

===== Using the administrative interface

. On the theme's project page on drupal.org (for example,
_https://www.drupal.org/project/mayo_), scroll to the _Downloads_ section
at the bottom of the page.

. Right-click _tar.gz_ to copy the address.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Appearance_
(_admin/appearance_). The _Appearance_ page appears.

. Click _Install new theme_. The _Install new theme_ page appears.

. In the field _Install from a URL_, paste the copied download link.

. Click _Install_ to upload and unpack the new theme on the server. The files
are being downloaded to the _themes_ directory.

. Click _Install newly added themes_ to return to the _Appearance_ page. If you
used the manual uploading procedure, start with this step, and reach the
_Appearance_ page by using the _Manage_ administrative menu and navigating
to _Appearance_ (_admin/appearance_).

. Locate the new theme under _Uninstalled themes_ and click _Install and set as
default_ to use it. All non-administrative pages on the site will now use this
new theme.

===== Using Drush

Now let's download and install another new theme using the command line and drush.

. Find the project name for the theme you want to install, which is the last
segment of the theme's project page URL. For example, if the project URL is
_https://www.drupal.org/project/mayo_, the project name is `mayo`.

. Run the following Drush commands, giving the project name (for example,
_mayo_) as a parameter:
+
----
drush dl mayo
drush en mayo
drush config-set system.theme default mayo
----

These download, then enable, then set mayo to be the default system theme for your site.

* If you do not see the effect of these changes in your site, you might need
to clear the cache.
