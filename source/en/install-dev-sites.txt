==== What are Development Sites?

Development Sites are different copies of the same Drupal site used for
developing, updating, and testing a site without risking the integrity of the
live site.

When building a Drupal site, your deployment workflow will usually include one
or more sites for developing and testing new features before going live
(development and staging sites) and a production site that you only update when
the new features you developed have proved to be safe to go live.

An example workflow:

* **Local environment**: The development process starts with developers working
  on new features, bug fixes, theming, configuration, etc. in their local
  environment.
* **Development site**: Developers push the changes they've been working on to
  the development site. For a team of more than one developer, version control
  is usually used. Git is a version control system that tracks your files for
  any changes. You can then commit those changes to a repository. Using Git
  allows team members to work on the same site without overriding each others'
  work. It also makes it possible to easily roll back to previous stages of the
  development.
* **Staging site**: The staging site can be used for testing, or presenting the
  changes to the client for approval. QA (Quality Assurance) and UAT (User
  Acceptance Testing) are most often carried out on the staging site. It is
  recommended to have live content on both the development and staging sites, so
  that you can test how the new features will work with the existing content.
* **Production site**: The live site on the web available to visitors.

Based on the project's size, scope, requirements, or stakeholders, stages from
the above workflow can be removed, or additional stages can be added. For
example a testing site before staging can be added to separate testing and user
acceptance processes.
