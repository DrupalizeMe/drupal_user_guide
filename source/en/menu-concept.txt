==== What is a menu?

Menus are a collection of links (menu items) used to navigate a website. The
core Menu UI module provides an interface to control and customize the menu
system. Menus are primarily displayed as a hierarchical list of links. By
default, new menu items are placed inside a built-in menu labeled _Main
navigation_, but administrators can also create custom menus. Each menu, whether
default or custom, has a block assigned to it.

The core Standard installation profile contains five menus:

Main navigation::
  Links to sections intended for site visitors. They are usually created by site
  administrators and displayed automatically in the page header of many themes.

Administration::
  Links to administrative tasks. This menu mainly contains links supplied by
  modules on your site. If you have the core Toolbar module installed, this menu
  is displayed when you click _Manage_. The contributed Admin Toolbar module
  also displays this menu.

User account menu::
  Links to tasks associated with the user account such as _My account_ and _Log
  out_.

Footer::
  Links to important pages within the site intended for the footer. They are
  usually created by site administrators. In order to display the footer, you
  need to place the footer menu block in the footer region of your theme.

Tools::
  Links to tasks necessary for site visitors. Some modules feature their links
  here.

You can also create your own custom menus, and display them by placing their
blocks. You can add custom menu items to a main menu, using the menu
administration functionality.

You can customize menus in the following ways:

* Reordering menu items by setting their "weight" or by dragging them into
place.

* Renaming menu items.

* Changing the link title (the tooltip that appears when you mouse over a menu
item).

* Moving a menu item into a different menu by editing its _Parent_ property.

A menu item will only be shown to a visitor if they have the rights to view the
page it links to. For example, the admin menu item is not shown to visitors who
are not logged in.
