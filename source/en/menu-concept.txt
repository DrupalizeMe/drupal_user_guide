==== What is a menu?

Menus are a collection of links (menu items) used to navigate a website. The
Menu module provides an interface to control and customize menu system. Menus
are primarily displayed as a hierarchical list of links using flexible blocks
feature. Each menu automatically creates a block of the same name. By default,
new menu items are placed inside a built-in menu labelled Main navigation, but
administrators can also create custom menus.

Drupal standard profile installation contains five menus:

Main menu::
  It's built by site administrators and displayed automatically in
  the page header of many themes (and if not, you can enable their blocks to
  display them).Main navigation menu usually contains links supplied by modules
  on your site.

Administration menu::
  It is displayed within the Admin toolbar.

User account menu::
  It contains links to the User account and the logout link.

Footer menu::
  It contains menu displayed at the footer of the webpage.

Custom menu::
  You can also create your own custom menus, and display them by
  enabling their blocks.You can also add custom menu items to a main menu, using
  the menu administration functionality.

You can customize menus in several ways, such as reordering menu items by
setting their "weight" or simply dragging them into place, renaming menu items,
and changing the link title (the tooltip that appears when you mouse over a menu
item). You can move a menu item into a different menu by editing the Parent
property of the menu item.

In all cases a menu item will only be shown to a visitor if they have the rights
to view the page it links to. For example, the admin menu item is not shown to
visitors who are not logged in.
