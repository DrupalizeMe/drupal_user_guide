Slide 1 (title): In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of adding a reference field.

Slide 2 (goal): By the end of this tutorial you will understand how to add a reference field so that recipes can be linked to the vendor that has submitted it.

Slide 3 (prereq): To follow along, you should understand the concepts of how to add basic fields to a content type, what reference fields are, and how a content type is created. Finally, the Recipe and Vendor content types must exist. See the written version of this tutorial for links to the prerequisite tutorials.

Demo:

1. In the Manage administrative menu, navigate to Structure > Content types, which is the (admin/structure/types) path. Then click Manage fields in the dropdown button for the Recipe content type. The Manage fields page appears.

2. Click Add field. The Add field page appears.

- We're going to add a new field. First, we'll select the field type Reference > Content.
- For a label, enter Submitted by.

3. The page Submitted by appears which lets you set its field settings.

- For Type of item to reference, which is an Option to select the type of referenced item, select Content.
- For Allowed number of values, select Limited, 1.

4. The page Submitted by settings for Recipe appears which allows you to configure the field as it exists in the Recipe content type.

- For label, enter Submitted by
- For help text, enter "Choose the vendor that submitted this recipe"
- Let's make this a required field and check this Required box.
- For Reference method, keep Default
- For Content Types, select Vendor
- For Sort by, select the sorting field Title, which will sort the values we can reference alphabetically by the Vendor content type's Title field.
- For Sort direction, select ascending, which will sort from A to Z.
- Click Save Settings

5. The Submitted by field has been added to the content type and a confirmation message appears.
