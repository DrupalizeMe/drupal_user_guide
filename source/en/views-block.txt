=== Adding a Block Display to a View

(((Views,adding block display)))

==== Goal

We want to show the most recent recipes on the site in a sideblock. Rather than
creating an entirely new view for it, we add a Block display to the already
existing Recipes view. Then we change the configuration, for this new display
only.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<views-concept>>
* <<views-parts>>
* <<views-create>>

==== Site prerequisites

* Recipe content type created, see <<structure-content-type>>.
* Main image fields added to Recipe content types, see <<structure-fields>>.
* Thumbnail 100x100 image style defined.
* Recipes view created, see <<views-duplicate>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Structure_ > _Views_
(admin/structure/views). Find the view "Recipes" and choose _Edit_ from its
drop-down operations. Alternatively, in the main visitor-facing site navigation
click on _Recipes_ to go to the Recipes page. There click on the appearing
pencil icon, then click on _Edit view_.

are automatically swithed to its configuration.
