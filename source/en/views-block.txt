==== Goal

Add a block display to the Recipes view to display the most recent recipes
in a sidebar, and change its configuration without changing the existing
recipes page view.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<views-concept>>
* <<views-parts>>
* <<views-create>>

==== Site prerequisites

* The Recipe content type must exist, it must have a Main Image field, and your
site must have a couple of Recipe content items. See <<structure-content-type>>,
<<structure-fields>>, <<structure-form-editing>>, and <<content-create>>.

* The _Thumbnail (100x100)_ image style must be defined. This is created on your
site when you install the core Image module, which is installed for you when you
install with the core Standard installation profile, but can be recreated if it
is deleted. See <<structure-image-style-create>>.

* The Recipes view must exist. See <<views-create>> and <<views-duplicate>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Structure_ > _Views_
(_admin/structure/views_). Find the view "Recipes" and click _Edit_ from its
dropdown button. Alternatively, navigate to the Recipes page in the main site
navigation, and click the _Edit view_ contextual link in the main area of the
page. See <<config-overview>> for information about contextual links.

. Click _Add_ in the Displays section and click _Block_ from the dropdown
button. The new display is created, and the focus is automatically switched to its
configuration.

// Add display button on Recipes view edit page, with Block highlighted
// (admin/structure/views/view/recipes).

. Next to _Display name_, click _Block_. This opens _The name and the
description of this display_ pop-up. Change the Administrative name to "Recent
recipes" and click _Apply_.

. In the Title section, click _Title: Recipes_. In the pop-up window, under
_For_, select _This block (override)_. Change the Title to "New Recipes" and
click _Apply (this display)_.

[start=5]
. In the Format section, click _Format: Grid_. Select _For This block
(override)_ in the pop-up that appears, check for "Unformatted
list" as style, and then click _Apply (this display)_. You can further
configure the _Style options_ in the next pop-up that appears.

. In the Fields section click on _Content: Main Image_. Choose _For This block
(override)_ the _Image style Thumbnail (100x100)_ then click on _Apply (this
display)_.

[start=7]
. In the Filter criteria section click _Content: Ingredients (exposed)_. Select
_For This Block (override)_ in the pop-up that appears and then click _Remove_
at the bottom.

. In the Sort criteria section click _Add_. In the appearing _Add sort
criteria_ pop-up select _For This block (override)_, check the field title
_Authored on_ (from Content category), and then _Add and configure sort
criteria_.

. In the appearing configuration pop-up select _Sort descending_ to have the
most recent recipes appear first, then apply.

. In the Pager section click _Use pager: Mini_. Select _For This block
(override)_ a pager to _Display a specified number of items_. Give 5 to be the
_"Items to display".

. Click _Save_. You will either see the view editing page again, or the Recipes
page, depending on what you did in step 1. You should also see a message saying
that the view has been saved.

// View saved confirmation message.

[start=12]
. Place this "Recipes: Recent Recipes" block in the _Sidebar second_ region. See
<<block-place>>. Navigate to the site home page to see the block.
