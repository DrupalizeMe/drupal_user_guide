=== Adding a Block Display to a View

(((View,adding block display to)))
(((Block display,adding to a view)))

==== Goal

Add a block display to the _Recipes_ views to display the most recent recipes
in a sidebar, and change its configuration without changing the existing
recipes page view.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<views-concept>>
* <<views-parts>>
* <<views-create>>

==== Site prerequisites

* The Recipe content type must exist, it must have a Main Image field, and your
site must have a couple of Recipe content items. See <<structure-content-type>>,
<<structure-fields>>, <<structure-form-editing>>, and <<content-create>>.

* The _Thumbnail (100x100)_ image style must be defined. This is created on your
site when you install the core Image module, which is installed for you when you
install with the core Standard installation profile, but can be recreated if it
is deleted. See <<structure-image-style-create>>.

* The Recipes view must exist. See <<views-create>> and <<views-duplicate>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Structure_ > _Views_
(_admin/structure/views_). Find the view "Recipes" and click _Edit_ from its
dropdown button. Alternatively, in the main visitor-facing site navigation
click _Recipes_ to go to the Recipes page. There click on the appearing
pencil icon, then click _Edit view_.
