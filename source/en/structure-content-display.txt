=== Changing Content Display

(((Content display, changing)))
(((Content display, managing)))
(((Content, displaying)))

==== Goal

Make the content items more readable, accessible and visibly attractive by
reordering the fields, hiding labels, and tuning the output of the fields.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<planning-data-types>>
* <<structure-view-modes>>

==== Site prerequisites

* The _Vendor_ content type is created with the fields _Main Image_ and _Vendor
URL_ . See <<structure-content-type>> and <<structure-fields>>.

* At least one published content item of this type exists. See
<<content-create>>.

==== Steps

When initially creating a content type and adding fields, the output will most
likely not look as desired. In the example below, the titles for _Main image_
and _Vendor URL_ are showing. The order of the items could also be changed to
create a more visually aligned page.

// Stand up Drupal 8.0.0-beta14 site and follow the scenario to create a
// vendor content type. Input text as described in scenario for Happy Farm.

initial output of the vendor content type",width="100%"]

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Structure_ > _Content
types_ (_admin/structure/types_). Then select the _Manage display_ drop down
for _Vendor_ content type.
+
// Under _Manage_ administrative menu select Structure > Content Types and
// select the _Manage fields_ drop down for _Vendor_ content type.

. Under the _Label_ column, select _Hidden_ for the _Main image_. Do the same
for the _Vendor URL_.

// Under the _Label_ column, select _Hidden_ for the _Main image_. Do the same
// for the _Vendor URL_.

selecting _main image title_ as _hidden_",width="100%"]

[start=3]
. Click the gear for the _Link_ field. Clear the _Trim link text length_.
Links will now not have a trim length. Select the _Open link in new window_
option. Now, when the link is clicked, it will open in a new window of the
browser. Click _Update_.
+
// Select the gear next to the _Link_ field and update according to above
// instructions of this step.

[start=4]
. Drag the cross arrows next to the field items to reorder as _Main image_,
_Body_, _Vendor URL_, _Links_.

. Click _Save_.
+
// Select the cross arrows next to the field items to reorder as _Main
// image_, _Body_, _Vendor URL_, _Links_.

You have updated the fields of the _Vendor_ content type to look more
visually appealing to the end-user. You now know how to hide field labels,
adjust link settings and reorder fields.

// Screen capture the content for the Happy Farm vendor after completing the
// above steps.

==== Follow-on tasks

* Notice that the main image takes up more space than you would like on the
page. To solve that, create an image style to control the display of this
image. See <<structure-image-style-create>>.

* Repeat the same steps to manage the display of the _Recipe_ content type
fields.
