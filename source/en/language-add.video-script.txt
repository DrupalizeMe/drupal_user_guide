Slide (title): In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of adding an additional language to your Drupal site.

Slide (goal): By the end of this tutorial, you will know how to add one or more languages to your site and define which one is used by default.

Slide (prereq): Before continuing, you should understand the concept of User Interface, Configuration, and Content translation. See the written version of this tutorial for a link to this prerequisite tutorial.

Demo:

1. First we need to install the four core multilingual modules. Navigate to Extend and check the boxes next to Language, Interface Translation, Content Translation, and Configuration Translation. Then scroll down the page and click save.

2. Next, In the Manage administrative menu, navigate to Configuration > Regional and language > Languages.

3. Click Add language.

4. Select Spanish (or your preferred language) from the Language name select list. Click Add language. After waiting for translations to finish downloading, you will be returned to the Languages page, with a confirmation message and the new language shown.
