Slide (title): In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of adding an additional language to your Drupal site.

Slide (goal): By the end of this tutorial, you will know how to add one or more languages to your site and define which one is used by default.

Slide (prereq): Before continuing, you should understand the concept of User Interface, Configuration, and Content translation. See the written version of this tutorial for a link to this prerequisite tutorial.

Demo:

1. First we need to install the four core multilingual modules. Navigate to Extend and check the boxes next to Language, Interface Translation, Content Translation, and Configuration Translation. Then scroll down the page and click save.

2. Next, In the Manage administrative menu, navigate to Configuration > Regional and language > Languages.

3. Click Add language.

4. Select Spanish (or your preferred language) from the Language name select list. Click Add language. After waiting for translations to finish downloading, you will be returned to the Languages page, with a confirmation message and the new language shown.

5. Now let's add the language switcher block to the sidebar.
  - In the Manage administrative menu, navigate to Structure > Block layout. The Block layout page appears, listing the themeâ€™s regions.
  - Ensure that in the secondary tab the core Bartik theme is selected since block placement is defined per theme.
  - Locate the region Sidebar second in the list and click Place block next to it. The Place block window appears, listing all the blocks.
  - Locate the block Language Switcher and click Place block next to it.
  - Click save block.
  - Now click back to site and we now have a language switcher block displayed in the sidebar.

Slide (recap): In this tutorial, we added a new language to our site. See the written version of this tutorial for links to related tutorials and tutorials to expand your understanding of this topic.
