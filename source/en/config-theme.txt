. Under "Color scheme" click inside each color build box and type the proper
color codes you would like to add. For this example, we are using the
following colors:

[width="100%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|================================
|Area | Color
|Header background top| #7db84a (green)
|Header background bottom| #2a3524 (dark green)
|Main background| #ffffff (white)
|Sidebar background| #f8bc65 (light orange)
|Sidebar borders| #e96b3c (orange)
|Footer background| #2a3524 (dark green)
|Title and slogan| #ffffff (white)
|Text color| #000000 (black)

wheel to the right to select colors, and the web color codes will be added for
you.

[start=5]
. Under "Upload logo image" select "Choose file" and locate the logo file you
want to upload to your site. Note: you can also set a universal logo for all
themes under _Appearance_ > _Settings_ (admin/appearance/settings). A custom
logo for your theme will override the universal logo.
+
Once you have selected the file you would like to upload, you will see the
filename next to the "Choose File" button under "Upload logo image."

. In order to save your changes and see that the colors and logo have been
changed on your site, select "Save configuration" at the bottom of the Bartik
"Settings" page.

. Please note, under the "Color scheme" of the "Settings" page for the Bartik
theme, you will find a "Preview" section which displays your website front page
with the settings administered.
+
//To create this image: followed all above steps of updating colors and logo, then took a screen shot including the "Preview" title with example preview of front page with updated settings.
