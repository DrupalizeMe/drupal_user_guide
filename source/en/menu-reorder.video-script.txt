Slide (title): In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to change the order of navigation.

Slide (goal): By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how to reorder the items in a menu.

Slide (prereq): To follow along, you should understand the concept of menus and how to add a page to navigation. See the written version of this tutorial for links to tutorials on both of these prerequisites.

Demo:

1. In the Manage administrative menu, navigate to Structure > Menus, which is the admin/structure/menu path. This is where all menus on your site are listed. Click Edit Menu from the Operations dropdown for Main navigation. You can also reach this page using a contextual link adjacent to a menu.
2. The Edit menu page will display a list of each item in the menu you chose. Let's choose Main navigation. We can see the two menu items in our main navigation: About and Home. Let's reorder this navigation so that Home is listed first.
3. Use the cross bar handles to reorder the menu items. Drag the Home menu item above the About menu item so that it appears first.
4. Click Save to save the new order.
5. The home page now displays the main navigation with the Home menu item displayed first.

Slide (recap): In this tutorial, we reordered the items in the main menu so that the home menu item was listed first.
