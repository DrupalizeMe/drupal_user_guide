=== Manually Downloading Module or Theme Files

(Slide/Intro)
How to manually download and upload a module or theme.

(Slide/Goal)

Manually download module or theme files and upload them to your site, if the
website or Drush methods for installing or updating a module or theme do not
work, or if you are placing a custom-written module or theme.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

- Concept: Modules
- Finding Modules
- Concept: Themes
- Finding Themes

You need to be facing any of the following to perform the manual download
described in this topic:

* File permission issues

* FTP permission issues

* You created a custom module/theme or received its files from someone

* You could not successfully complete the instructions in
the Module installation, theme installation, update a security release for a module or theme. You can skip this topic if none of the above applies to you.

If you need help with any of these prerequisites consult the written version of this tutorial for links.

(Demo/Browser)

If you are installing a module or theme from _Drupal.org_, follow the
downloading instructions, and then the uploading/unpacking instructions. If
you created the module or theme, skip the downloading step. Instead, create
an archive file (that you know how to extract on the server) and proceed with
the steps in uploading/unpacking, using whatever method is appropriate for the
way you initially created the archive file.

===== Downloading the files

. Open the module or theme project page on drupal.org; for example, the _Admin
toolbar_ page (https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_toolbar).

. Scroll to the _Downloads_ section near the bottom of the page.

. Click _tar.gz_ to download the file to your computer.

===== Uploading the files to your site and unpacking them

. If you are adding a new module or theme, create subdirectories in your
top-level _modules_ and _themes_ directories (if they don't already
exist). Typically, people make a _contrib_ subdirectory for contributed modules
and themes that are downloaded from _Drupal.org_, and a _custom_ subdirectory for
modules and themes that they created. Your _modules_ directory might look like
this:

. If you are replacing an existing module or theme with an updated version, put
the site into maintenance mode.

. If you are replacing an existing module or theme with an updated version, find
and delete all the existing files and directories for the existing module
or theme. Modules are normally located in directories under the top-level
_modules_ directory, and themes are normally located in directories under the
top-level _themes_ directory.

. Upload the _.tar.gz_ file (or whatever archive you created) to your site.
Place it in either the same location from which you deleted the directory
(if replacing an existing module or theme) or the appropriate subdirectory
of _modules_ or _themes_ (if adding a new module or theme).

. Extract the files from the _.tar.gz_ archive (or whatever archive you
created), making a subdirectory in the same location as the archive file.
If you do not have terminal access, or your hosting server is not running
Linux, your hosting control panel's file manager should provide a way to
extract the files. If you have terminal access to your hosting server
(running Linux) and you are using a tar.gz file, you can use a command like:

+
----
tar -xzf admin_toolbar-8.x-1.17.tar.gz
----

. Delete the compressed file from the server, unless your unpacking method
already deleted it.

. Refer to the module or theme installation tutorials to complete the
installation or update of the module or theme. Start at the step after the
automatic download has been completed.
