Slide (title): In this tutorial, we’ll add a page to the navigation.

Slide (goal): By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how to add a page to the navigation and you will add the About page that you created in a previous tutorial to a menu.

Slide (prereq): To follow along, you should understand the concept of menus and how to edit a content item. See the written version of this tutorial for links to tutorials on both of these prerequisites.

Demo:

1. In the Manage administrative menu, navigate to Content, which is the admin/content path.
2. Find the About page, and click Edit in that row. The content editing form appears.
3. Click Menu settings on the right to expand it.
4. Check Provide a menu link for the menu options to appear.
5. Now let's enter the following values:

- The menu link title is Title that will be displayed in the menu. Enter "About".
- The description is the Text that will be displayed when a visitor hovers over the link. Enter "History of the market"
- The Parent item is the Location of the page in the menu hierarchy. For example, if you choose <Main navigation>, the page will appear in the highest level of the navigation. By choosing another menu item as parent, you can create a menu hierarchy of multiple levels. Select "<Main Navigation".
- The Weight is The order in which the page should appear in the menu (lower-weighted menu items will be shown before higher-weighted menu items). Enter -2. In a separate tutorial, we'll discuss how to change the order of menu items in the navigation.
- Click Save and keep published to save the changes. Click Home or Return to site in the navigation bar to see the result, which could look like the picture below.


Slide (recap): In this tutorial, we added the “About” page to the main navigation menu.
