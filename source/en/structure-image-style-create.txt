=== Setting Up an Image Style

(((Image styles,creating)))
(((Images,resizing)))

==== Goal

By creating image styles you can apply one or more image effects on the
images that you upload. For example you might upload any image to a Vendor or
Recipe page and display it consistently scaled and cropped to 300 by 200
pixels.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<structure-fields>>
* <<structure-content-display>>
* <<structure-image-styles>>

==== Site prerequisites

* The content types _Vendor_ and _Recipe_ exist and they have Image fields
called _Main Image_. See <<structure-fields>>.

* You have created one _Vendor_ content item. See <<content-create>>

==== Steps

You can create an image style that scales and crops the images to 300 by 200
pixels and use this to display images on Vendor pages.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Configuration_ > _Media_ >
_Image styles_ (admin/config/media/image-styles).

. Click _Add image style_

. Enter the name _Extra medium (300x200)_

. Click Create new style. You will see the page Edit style Extra medium
(300x200) where you can define the effects for this new style.

. In the Effect table choose _Scale and crop_ and click _Add_

. Fill in the fields as shown below.
+
[width="100%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|================================
|Field name | Value
|Width | 300
|Height | 200
|================================

. Click _Add effect_. The image style is saved with the chosen effects.
+
// Add a new image style and enter the values as shown in the table above.

[start=8]
. Open the _Content types_ page via Structure > Content types
(admin/structure/types/manage).

. Next to _Vendor_ choose _Manage display_ from the _Operations_ dropbutton. The
_Manage display_ page (admin/structure/types/manage/vendor/display) appears.

. Ensure that the secondary tab _Default_ is selected.

. Next to _Main Image_ click the cogwheel. The option fields appear.

. Fill in the fields as shown below.
+
[width="100%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|================================
|Field name | Value
|Image style | Extra medium (300x200)
|Link image to | Nothing
|================================

. Click _Update_

. Click _Save_. The new image style will be used when displaying Vendor content.
+
// Open manage display tab of Vendor content type.
image:images/structure-image-style-create-manage-display.png["Change field formatter settings of image field",width="100%"]

[start=15]
. Open a _Vendor_ content item and verify that it now shows up with the
scaled-down image. See <<content-edit>> for information on how to locate an
existing content item.
