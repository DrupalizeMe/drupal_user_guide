=== Configuring Text Formats and Editors

(((Text formats,configuring)))
(((Editors,configuring)))

==== Goal

By configuring _Text Formats_ you decide how HTML tags and other text that has been entered by the user will be processed and displayed in the site. You also define if a Text editor is available, so that users do not need to enter HTML code.

For the text editor to be available, it has to be assigned to a text formats. By default the text editor _Ckeditor_ is assigned to the _Basic HTML_ and _Full HTML_ text formats. You can configure the toolbar of the text editor, for example to make the _horizontal rule_ button (corresponding with the _HR_ HTML tag) available to the user.

By default all not allowed HTML tags are being removed by the text format when the page is being generated (the original input is being preserved in the database). If, for example, you let users embed YouTube videos, you will need to add the IFRAME tag as an allowed HTML tag.

A text format has multiple filters that are processed in a particular order. The order is important because one filter can prevent another filter from working properly. For example, when URLs are converted into links before HTML tags are removed, all links may be removed. You can configure the order in which filters are processed.
