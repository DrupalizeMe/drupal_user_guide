==== Goal

Manually download module or theme files and upload them to your site, if the
website or Drush methods for installing or updating a module or theme do not
work, or if you are placing a custom-written module or theme.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<understanding-modules>>
* <<extend-module-find>>
* <<understanding-themes>>
* <<extend-theme-find>>

==== Site prerequisites

You want to install or update a module or theme, and the automatic downloading
instructions in <<extend-module-install>>, <<extend-theme-install>>,
<<security-update-module>>, or <<security-update-theme>>, using Drush or the web
interface, do not succeed (or you are installing or updating a custom module or
theme, which cannot be downloaded automatically).

==== Steps

If you are installing a module or theme from _Drupal.org_, follow the Downloading
and unpacking instructions, and then the uploading instructions. If you created
the module or theme, skip the downloading and unpacking steps.

===== Downloading and unpacking the files

. Open the module or theme project page on drupal.org; for example, the _Admin
toolbar_ page (https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_toolbar).

. Scroll to the _Downloads_ section near the bottom of the page.

// For this screenshot got https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_toolbar and
// crop to the downloads section. Highlight the tar.gz link.

. Click _tar.gz_ or _zip_ to download the file to your computer.

. Extract the files into a directory.

===== Uploading the files to your site

. If you are adding a new module or theme, create subdirectories in your
top-level _modules_ and _themes_ directory (if they don't already
exist). Typically, people make a _contrib_ subdirectory for contributed modules
and themes that are downloaded from _Drupal.org_, and a _custom_ subdirectory for
modules and themes that they created. Your modules directory might look like
this:

// Make custom and contrib directories under modules, and take a screen shot
// showing the directory structure.

structure for modules"]

. If you are replacing an existing module or theme with an updated version, put
the site into maintenance mode. See <<extend-maintenance>>.

. If you are replacing an existing module or theme with an updated version, find
and delete the all of the existing files and directories for the existing module
or theme. Modules are normally located in directories under the top-level
_modules_ directory, and themes are normally located in directories under the
top-level _themes_ directory.

. Copy the extracted directory to either the same location as the one you
deleted (if replacing an existing module or theme) or the appropriate
subdirectory of _modules_ or _themes_ (if adding a new module or theme).

. Refer to <<extend-module-install>>, <<extend-theme-install>>,
<<security-update-module>>, or <<security-update-theme>> to complete the
installation or update of the module or theme. Start at the step after the
automatic download has been completed.

==== Follow-on tasks

* If you work with multiple environments (for example, a local development site
and a production site) you will have to repeat the steps on each environment, or
re-clone the environment. See <<install-dev-making>>.

* If you added a new theme, navigate in the _Manage_ administrative menu to
_Appearance_ (_admin/appearance_) and uninstall the old theme.
