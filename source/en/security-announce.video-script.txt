=== Keeping Track of Updates

(Slide/Intro)
This tutorial covers how to secure a site by staying informed about the latest security updates.

(Slide/Goal)
By the end of this tutorial you'll know how to keep up with the latest security updates in order to ensure that your site is safe and up-to-date.

(Slide/Prerequisites)
While not strictly speaking required, before you start with this tutorial it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with what security updates are, why they are important, and how they are created.

See the written version of this tutorial for links to each of these prerequisite tutorials.

(Demo/Browser - Drupal site)
There are a few different ways to receive notifications of security releases and we'll walk through each of them briefly:

First up, you can configure your site to notify you of updates, this method is especially useful because it only notifies you about things that are relevant to your site. In the Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to Reports > Available updates > Settings. On this page you can enter the email addresses to be notified when updates are
available. You can also specify whether you want daily or weekly updates. Once you're done, click Save configuration.

(Browser/Drupal.org - user profile page)
Another option is to subscribe to the security announcements email list. Here you'll get an email, usually once a week, with all security announcements for that week. Including core, and all monitored contrib modules.

To subscribe, log in to Drupal.org, go to your user profile page and subscribe to the security newsletter on the Edit > My newsletters_ tab.

(Demo/Browser - drupal.org/security)
Also on drupal.org, you can navigate to drupal.org/security, which lists all available security announcements, and links to the @drupalsecuirty twitter account which you could follow for updates.

(Slide/RSS)
And finally, you can subscribe to one or more of the RSS feeds for
- core security updates (https://www.drupal.org/security/rss.xml[),
- contributed project updates - https://www.drupal.org/security/contrib/rss.xml
- and public service announcements - https://www.drupal.org/security/psa/rss.xml.

(Slide/Recap)
In this tutorial we looked at various ways you can subscribe to get notified about security updates for core and contributed modules. Including:

- Via your site itself
- Via the security mailing list on drupal.org
- Via Twitter
- or by subscribing to one of the of the drupal.org security RSS feeds
