==== Prerequisite knowledge

//==== Site prerequisites

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Appearance_
(_admin/appearance_).

. Under _Installed themes_, you will find Olivero listed as your default
theme. Under _Olivero (default theme)_, click _Settings_.

--

. Under _Upload logo image_, locate a logo file and upload it to your
site. Note: You can also set a universal logo for all themes under
_Appearance_ > _Settings_ (_admin/appearance/settings_). A custom logo for your
theme will override the universal logo.
+
Once you have selected the file you would like to upload, you will see its
filename next to the _Choose File_ or _Browse_ button in your browser.

. Under _Olivero Utilities_, you can choose to use a different color scheme for
the theme. You can choose from a list of existing color scheme's, or enter a
color and the core software will generate a new scheme based on that color.

For example, use the following custom color:
+
[width="100%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|================================
|Field | Color
|Primary base color| #7db84a (green)
|================================
+
Note: You can also use a color picker by pressing the colored square on the
right to select a color of your choice. The web color codes will be added for
you.

. In order to save your changes and see the updated colors and logo on your
site, click _Save configuration_ at the bottom of the page.

. Click _Return to site_ or _Home_ in the toolbar to verify that you have
updated the core Olivero theme settings for your website.
