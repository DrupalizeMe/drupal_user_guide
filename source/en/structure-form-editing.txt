=== Changing Content Entry Forms

(((Content,editing entry form)))

==== Goal

Change the _Recipe_ form to use a different widget to enter terms in the
_Ingredients_ field.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<structure-content-type>>
* <<structure-fields>>
* <<structure-taxonomy>>
* <<structure-widgets>>

==== Site prerequisites

The Recipe content type must exist, and it must have an Ingredients taxonomy
term reference field. See <<structure-content-type>> and
<<structure-taxonomy-setup>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Content_ > _Add content_ >
_Recipe_ (_node/add/recipe_) to look at the content entry form that is set up by
default. Notice how you have to enter ingredients one by one, instead of having
a more compact format.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Structure_ > _Content
types_ (_admin/structure/types_). Then click _Manage form display_  on the
dropdown button for the _Recipe_ content type. The _Manage form display_ page
appears.

. For the _Ingredients_ field select in the _Widget_ column the option
_Autocomplete (Tags style)_.

. Click _Save_.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Content_ > _Add content_ >
_Recipe_ (_node/add/recipe_) to verify the changed behaviour of the content
form. The _Ingredients_ field is now a single text field that accepts multiple
values.

// For the image have a Recipe content type with Ingredients taxonomy field and add a Recipe node.

. Create two Recipe content items (see <<content-create>>), such as recipes for
"Green Salad" and "Fresh Carrots". Make sure all of the fields have values,
including images, ingredients, and submitted by (set this to one of the Vendor
content items you created in <<structure-fields>>).

==== Follow-on tasks

Change the main site Contact form by navigating in the _Manage_ administrative
menu to _Structure_ > _Contact forms_. For instance you may want to hide the
_Send yourself a copy_ or _Language_ fields.
