=== Changing Content Entry Forms

(((Content entry forms, editing)))

==== Goal

Change the _Recipe_ form to use a different widget to enter terms in the
_Ingredients_ field.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<structure-content-type>>
* <<structure-fields>>
* <<structure-taxonomy>>
* <<structure-widgets>>

==== Site prerequisites

Your site needs to have a Recipe content type (see <<structure-content-type>>)
with an _Ingredients_ taxonomy term reference field (see
<<structure-taxonomy-setup>>).

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Structure_ > _Content
types_ (admin/structure/types). Then click _Manage form display_ drop-down
for _Recipe_ content type. The _Manage form display_ page appears.

. For the _Ingredients_ field select in the _Widget_ column the option
_Autocomplete (Tags style)_.

. Click _Save_.

[start=4]
. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Content_ > _Add content_ >
_Recipe_ (node/add/recipe) to verify the changed behaviour of the content
form. The _Ingredients_ field is now a single text field that accepts multiple
values.

==== Follow-on tasks

Change the main site Contact form by navigating in the _Manage_ administrative
menu to _Structure_ > _Contact forms_. For instance you may want to hide the
_Send yourself a copy_ or _Language_ fields.
