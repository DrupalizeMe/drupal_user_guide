=== Configuring User Account Settings

(Slide/Intro)
This tutorial covers how to change user account registration settings.

(Slide/Goal)
By the end of this tutorial you'll be able to turn off the ability for people to register user accounts on the site. As well as review and edit the email messages generated by the site for events related to user accounts.

(Slide/Prerequisites)
Before you begin you'll want to make sure you're already familiar with signing in to and the basics of navigating the administrative interface.

(Demo/Browser)
In the Manage administrative menu, click on Configuration, then People, and then Account settings (admin/config/people/accounts).

Under Registration and cancellation you can change various aspects of how users are able to register an account on the site. Select Administrators only as the people with permissions to register user accounts. You can also check Require email verification when a visitor creates an account in case you want to change the settings for account registration later on.

Optionally, change the default email address from which user account notifications from the farmers market website will be sent. This will help you maintain a separate email address from the one used for the website in general. For example, this email address for user account notifications will be useful for a staff member(s) communicating with vendors. We'll set it to support@example.com.

Optionally, edit the email templates in the Emails section to customize automated emails. There are seven email templates available. They are meant for different user-specific occasions. All of them can be personalized and three can be disabled via checkboxes: activation, blocking, and cancellation.

You can send out your own text (for example, welcoming the new vendors for whom accounts were just created) by editing the the _Welcome (new user created by
administrator)_ template.

After making your changes click _Save configuration_ to save the changes. You should be present with a message indicating that the settings have been updated.
