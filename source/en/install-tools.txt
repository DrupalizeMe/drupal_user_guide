==== What tools are available for site builders?

There are several additional tools available that help you create sites faster,
more accurate and with less effort.

Drush::
  http://www.drush.org[Drush] is a command line tool for building and
  maintaining sites. It has commands for installing modules, updating and
  copying databases, executing database queries, resetting passwords, clearing
  caches and many, many more. Drupal modules and themes can add their own
  commands to Drush.
Git::
  http://git-scm.com[Git] is a version control system you can use to track
  changes made to files within your entire site, or just the module or theme
  that you are working on. Git makes it possible to try out changes, and if
  necessary, revert to a previous version. It can be used as well to track
  changes in the configuration files and synchronize the configuration of
  different environments. Git has become the standard for web development
  projects.
Devel::
  http://drupal.org/project/devel[Devel] is a contributed module that helps with
  development tasks such as debugging and inspecting code, analyzing database
  queries and generating dummy content.

==== What tools are available for module and theme developers?

In addition to the site builder tools mentioned above, the following tools are
useful for module and theme developers.

Drupal Console::
  https://drupalconsole.com[Drupal Console] is a command line tool that
  generates boilerplate code and interacts with a Drupal 8 site. It can generate
  for example block or form code, install modules and themes and create dummy
  content. Drupal Console makes use of the Symfony Console.
Coder::
  https://www.drupal.org/project/coder[Coder] is a command line tool that checks
  if your modules and themes comply with coding standards and other best
  practices. It can also fix coding standard violations.
Firebug::
  http://getfirebug.com[Firebug] is a Firefox plugin that allows viewing,
  editing, debugging, and monitoring CSS, HTML, and JavaScript in a separate
  browser window. The contributed module
  https://www.drupal.org/project/drupalforfirebug[Drupal for Firebug] displays
  Drupal debugging and SQL query information to the Firebug window.
