==== Goal

Create a page with all recipes by duplicating the existing Vendors view and
modify it so that the recipes are displayed in a grid and can by filtered by
ingredients.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<views-concept>>
* <<views-parts>>
* <<views-create>>

==== Site prerequisites

* The Vendor and Recipe content types must exist; both must have Main Image
fields, and the Recipe content type must have an Ingredients field. Your site
must also have a couple of Recipe content items. See <<structure-content-type>>,
<<structure-fields>>, <<structure-taxonomy-setup>>, <<structure-form-editing>>,
and <<content-create>>.

* The Vendors view must exist. See <<views-create>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Structure_ > _Views_
(_admin/structure/views_). Find the view "Vendors" and click _Duplicate_ in its
dropdown button.

. Name the duplicate "Recipes", confirm by clicking _Duplicate_. The view
configuration page appears.

. Click Vendors (which was just duplicated) in the _Title_ section. _The title
of this view_ pop-up appears. Title it "Recipes" then click _Apply (all

. In the _Format_ section click _Table_ next to _Format_. The _Page: How should
this view be styled_ pop-up appears.  Select _Grid_ and click _Apply (all
displays)_. The _Page: Style options_ pop-up appears where you can customize
your grid's appearance. Retain the default values and click _Apply_.

. In the _Fields_ section check _Content: Body_ and then click _Remove_ in the
pop-up. This leaves the Recipes view with the title and image only.

. In the _Filter criteria_ section change filtering from _Content:
Type(=Vendor)_ to filtering only for recipe content types: in the pop-up check
Recipe and uncheck Vendor then click _Apply(all displays)_.

. Add a further filter, one exposed to visitors: click _Add_ in the _Filter
criteria_ section then search for "ingredients". Select _Ingredients
(field_ingredients)_ via its checkbox then _Apply (all displays)_.

type. Click _Apply and continue_. The next pop-up allows to expose this
filter to visitors. Fill in the fields as shown below.

[start=9]
. In the _Page settings_ section change _Path: /vendors_ to _/recipes_. Give the
new path "recipes" in the pop-up and click _Apply_. Then via the _Menu_ pop-up
change the menu link title to "Recipes". Click _Apply_.

. Click _Advanced_ to expand the _Advanced_ section of the configuration
page. In the _Other_ section change _Use AJAX: No_ to "Yes" by clicking _No_ and
checking _Use AJAX_ in the pop-up that appears. Then click _Apply_.

==== Follow-on tasks

The link to the view in the main navigation will probably not be in the right
place. Change the order of the menu items in the main navigation. See
<<menu-reorder>>.
