=== Duplicating a View

(((Views,duplicating)))

==== Goal

We explore the _views_ content type settings: we first _duplicate_ (or clone)
the view called "Vendors" into "Recipes", then _modify_ its configuration. The
result is a new page displaying all recipes (title and picture) in a grid, with
an option to filter on ingredients.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<views-concept>>
* <<views-parts>>
* <<views-create>>

==== Site prerequisites

* Vendor and Recipe content types created, see <<structure-content-type>>.

* Main image fields added to Vendor and Recipe content types, see
<<structure-fields>>.

* Vendors view created, see <<views-create>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Structure_ > _Views_
(admin/structure/views). Find the view "Vendors" and choose _Duplicate_ from its
drop-down operations.

[start=2]
. Name the duplicate "Recipes", confirm by clicking on _Duplicate_. The view
configuration page appears.

. Click _Vendors_ (what we just duplicated) in the _Title_ section. _The title
of this view_ pop-up appears. Title it "Recipes" then click _Apply (all
displays)_.

[start=4]
. In the _Format_ section change _Format: Unformatted_ to grid by choosing the
style _Grid_ in the pop-up configurations. Further options on style settings
appear. Click _Apply (all displays)_.

. In the _Fields_ section click on _Content: Body_ then choose _Remove_ in the
pop-up. This leaves our Recipes view with the title and image only.

. In the _Filter criteria_ section change filtering from _Content:
Type(=Vendor)_ to filtering only for recipe content types: in the pop-up check
_Recipe_ and uncheck _Vendor_ then click _Apply(all displays)_.

. We add a further filter, one exposed to visitors: click _Add_ in the _Filter
criteria_ section then search for "ingredients". Select _Ingredients
(field_ingredients)_ via its checkbox then _Apply (all displays)_.

//To create this image, take a screenshot on admin/structure/views/recipes with the _Add filter criteria_ pop-up open, searching for "ingredients" fields.

[start=8]
. The appearing pop-up offers extra settings on vocabulary and selection
type. _Apply and continue_. The next configuration pop-up allows to _expose this
filter to visitors_: check. Within the appearing extra settings give the _Label_
"Find recipes using...". Confirm by clicking on _Apply(all displays)_.
+
//To create this image, take a screenshot on admin/structure/views/recipes with the _Configure filter criterion_ pop-up open, check in "Expose this filter to visitors" and give Label "Find recipes using...".

[start=9]
. In the _Page settings_ section change _Path: /vendors_ to /recipes: give the
new path "recipes" in the pop-up then _Apply_. Then via the _Menu_ pop-up change
the menu link title to "Recipes".

. Roll out the _Advanced_ sections. In the _Other_ section change _Use AJAX: No_
to "Yes": click on "No" and choose for using AJAX in the pop-up then _Apply_.

. Save all the above changes by clicking on _Save_ of the _Displays_ panel.

. Go back to site, and we see the new page Recipes.

==== Follow-on tasks

The link to the view in the main navigation will probably not be in the right
place. Change the order of the menu items in the main navigation. See
<<menu-reorder>>.
