//==== Site prerequisites

==== Steps

There are several options for installing Drupal. You can use an external service
that provides you with an automated installation, or you can choose to install
Drupal yourself on your own computer or server. If you install it yourself, you
can use Drush or the web installer.

===== Automated installation on an external server

Free online options::
  Use an online provider to get a demo installation of Drupal in 20 minutes or
  less.
  See the https://www.drupal.org/try-drupal[Drupal.org page "Try Drupal"].

Install Drupal at your hosting provider::
  If you choose to install Drupal at your hosting provider, your hosting
  provider may have specific documentation and/or a one-click install that you
  can use.

  See
  https://www.drupal.org/supporters/hosting[Drupal.org's list of hosting providers that support Drupal].

===== Install using Drush

Type the following at the Drush command line:

----
drush dl drupal --drupal-project-rename=example
cd example
drush site-install standard --db-url='mysql://DB_USER:DB_PASS@localhost/DB_NAME' --site-  name=Example
----

For additional information refer to the
http://www.drush.org/en/master[Drush Documentation].

===== Install using the web installer

To install Drupal manually, you will need to:

. Create a database.

. Get a full-access database user.

. Download Drupal core or the Drupal distribution you would like to use.

. Place the files in the web root.

. Make _sites/default_ writeable.

. Create the files _sites/default/settings.php_ and _sites/default/services.yml_ and
make sure these are writeable.

. Run the installer. See <<install-run>>.
