==== Goal

Choose an appropriate way to install the core software, and handle any
required prerequisites.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<install-requirements>>
* <<install-tools>>

==== Site prerequisites

If you want to use Drush to install the core software, Drush must be
installed. See <<install-tools>>.

==== Steps

. Choose a method for installing the core software.

Try a free online demo::
  Use an online provider to get a demo installation of the core software in 20
  minutes or less. See the
  https://www.drupal.org/try-drupal[_Drupal.org_ page "Try Drupal"].

Use a one-click installer from your hosting provider::
  If you choose to install the core software at your hosting provider, your
  hosting provider may have specific documentation and/or a one-click install
  that you can use. See
  https://www.drupal.org/supporters/hosting[_Drupal.org's_ list of hosting providers that support Drupal].

Use Drush::
  You will need to have Drush installed and command-line access to the site. See
  <<install-tools>>.

Use the web installer::
  You will need space on a local or hosted web server to install the core
  software manually.

. If you are installing using Drush or the web installer, set up a URL and
hosting for your site, either at an external hosting provider or on your own
computer. Verify that the hosting is working by putting a simple HTML file in
the web root directory of the hosting, and visiting the URL for your site.

. If you are installing using Drush or the web installer, create a database,
along with a database user account with full access.

. If you are installing using Drush, type the following at the Drush command
line, where _example_ is the name of the directory that the core software will
be downloaded to, and _DB_NAME_, _DB_USER_ and _DB_PASS_ are your database's
credentials:
+
----
drush dl drupal --drupal-project-rename=example
cd example
drush site-install standard --db-url='mysql://DB_USER:DB_PASS@localhost/DB_NAME' --site- name=example
----

[start=5]
. If you are installing using web installer, upload the core software files
manually. You will need to:

[start=1]
.. Go to _https://www.drupal.org_ and click _Download & Extend_ on the top-level
menu.

// Main area of https://www.drupal.org/download.

[start=2]
.. Click the green download button under _Core_ to be taken to the Downloads
page.

// Recommended releases section of https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal.

[start=3]
.. Click the version you wish to download under _Recommended releases_.

// File section of a recent Drupal release download page, such as
// https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.1.3.
image:images/install-prepare-files.png["Download files section of Drupal core download page on _Drupal.org_"]

[start=4]
.. Download the tar.gz or zip file to the web root in your local machine.

.. Upload the downloaded files to your hosting account. Log in to the control
panel and navigate to the _HTML_ directory. Save the Drupal files in a new
directory at the same level as other sites you are hosting.

.. Uncompress the tar.gz or zip file. A new directory will be created featuring
all the uncompressed Drupal files. Optionally, rename the directory to match
your custom site's name.

==== Expand your understanding

Run the installer if you chose web installer to install the core software. See
<<install-run>>.
