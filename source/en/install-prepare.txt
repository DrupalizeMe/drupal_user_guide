[role="summary"]
How to download the core software and satisfy prerequisites for installation.

(((Downloading,core software)))
(((Drupal core,preparing install)))

==== Goal

Download the core software, and handle any required prerequisites.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<install-requirements>>

* <<install-tools>>

* <<install-decide>>

* How to install and configure server software (if installing on your own
computer)

* How to set up hosting for a generic web site

* How to create a database

==== Site prerequisites

Server software must be installed on the computer where you plan to host your
site. See <<install-requirements>>.

Depending on how you plan to download the core software, you may need to install
additional software tools first. See <<install-decide>> and <<install-tools>>.

==== Steps

. Choose methods for downloading and installing the core software, from those
listed in <<install-decide>>. The rest of these instructions apply to the
Composer and manual download options and the interactive installer; if you chose
other options, the software should be installed for you.

. Set up a URL and hosting for your site on the server. Verify that the hosting
is working by putting a simple HTML file in the web root directory of the
hosting, and visiting the URL for your site.

. Create a database, along with a database user account with full access.

. Download the core software files to the web root directory, using the method
you decided on. See <<install-decide>> for links to instructions.

==== Expand your understanding

See <<install-run>> to run the interactive installer.

Alternatively, you can use the following Drush command, from inside the
directory that you downloaded the software to, where _DB_NAME_, _DB_USER_ and
_DB_PASS_ are your database's credentials:

----
drush site-install standard --db-url='mysql://DB_USER:DB_PASS@localhost/DB_NAME' --site-name=example
----
