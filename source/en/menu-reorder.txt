(((Navigation,changing the order of menu items)))

==== Goal

Reorder the items in a menu.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<menu-concept>>
* <<menu-link-from-content>>

==== Site prerequisites

There must be at least two items in the main navigation menu. See
<<menu-link-from-content>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to Structure > Menus
(_admin/structure/menu_) where all menus on your site are listed. Choose the one
you want to change by clicking _Edit Menu_ from its _Operations_ dropdown
button. You can also reach this page using the
<<config-overview,contextual links>> for the menu.

. The _Edit Menu_ page will display a list of each item in the menu you
chose. For this task we had chosen _Main navigation_
+
// In the _Manage_ administrative menu select _Structure_ > _Menus_ > _Main navigation_ > _Edit Menu_. Take the capture including the _Edit navigation_ title and list of menu items.

[start=3]
. Use the cross bar handles to reorder the menu items. For this task, we are
going to move the "Home" menu item above the "About" menu item so that it
appears first.
+
// Drag the "Home" menu item above the _About_ menu item and capture the highlighted adjustment and warning of unsaved changes message.

[start=4]
. Click _Save_ (as pictured in previous step).

. The home page now displays our Main navigation menu items with the _Home_ menu
item displayed first.
+
// Capture the home page with the Main navigation items in the order of "Home" and then "About".

==== Follow-on tasks

Add a menu item called _Contact_, leading to the _/contact_ page, to your Main
navigation menu. The contact page is provided by the core Contact module; you
may want to edit its layout and fields (see <<structure-form-editing>>).
