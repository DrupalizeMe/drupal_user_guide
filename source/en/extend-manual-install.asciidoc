==== Goal

Custom modules and themes may not be available via Composer and their files will
need to be manually installed.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<understanding-modules>>
* <<extend-module-find>>
* <<understanding-themes>>
* <<extend-theme-find>>

==== Site prerequisites

Use this approach if you created a custom module/theme or received its files
from someone.

When installing or updating the core software, contributed modules, and
contributed themes you should use Composer. See <<install-composer>>,
<<extend-module-install>>, and <<extend-theme-install>> instead of this topic.

==== Steps

If you are installing a module or theme from _Drupal.org_, follow the
downloading instructions, and then the uploading/unpacking instructions. If
you created the module or theme, skip the downloading step. Instead, create
an archive file (that you know how to extract on the server) and proceed with
the steps in uploading/unpacking, using whatever method is appropriate for the
way you initially created the archive file.

===== Uploading the files to your site and unpacking them

. If you are adding a new module or theme, create subdirectories in your
top-level _modules_ and _themes_ directories (if they don't already
exist). Typically, people make a _contrib_ subdirectory for contributed modules
and themes that are downloaded from _Drupal.org_, and a _custom_ subdirectory
for modules and themes that they created. Your _modules_ directory might look
like this:
+
--
// Make custom and contrib directories under modules, and take a screenshot
// showing the directory structure.

// NOTE for Translators: you don't need to localize the 'custom' and 'contrib' directory names as they are more common in English.
--

. If you are replacing an existing module or theme with an updated version, put
the site into maintenance mode. See <<extend-maintenance>>.

. If you are replacing an existing module or theme with an updated version, find
and delete all the existing files and directories for the existing module
or theme. Modules are normally located in directories under the top-level
_modules_ directory, and themes are normally located in directories under the
top-level _themes_ directory.

. Upload the _.tar.gz_ file (or whatever archive you created) to your site.
Place it in either the same location from which you deleted the directory
(if replacing an existing module or theme) or the appropriate subdirectory
of _modules_ or _themes_ (if adding a new module or theme).

. Extract the files from the _.tar.gz_ archive (or whatever archive you
created), making a subdirectory in the same location as the archive file.
If you do not have terminal access, or your hosting server is not running
Linux, your hosting control panel's file manager should provide a way to
extract the files. If you have terminal access to your hosting server
(running Linux) and you are using a tar.gz file, you can use a command like:
+
----
tar -xzf custom_toolbar-2.4.0.tar.gz
----

. Delete the compressed file from the server, unless your unpacking method
already deleted it.

. Refer to <<extend-module-install>>, <<extend-theme-install>>,
<<security-update-module>>, or <<security-update-theme>> to complete the
installation or update of the module or theme. Start at the step after the
automatic download has been completed.

==== Expand your understanding

* If you work with multiple environments (for example, a local development site
and a production site) you will have to repeat the steps on each environment, or
re-clone the environment. See <<install-dev-making>>.

* If you added a new theme, navigate in the _Manage_ administrative menu to
_Appearance_ (_admin/appearance_) and uninstall the old theme.
