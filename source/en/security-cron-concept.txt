//==== Prerequisite knowledge

==== What is Cron?

To ensure that your site site and its modules continue to function well, a group
of administrative operations should be run periodically. These operations are
called _cron_ tasks. Examples of cron tasks are: checking for module and theme
updates, indexing content for search, or cleaning up temporary files.

The core Automated Cron module runs the cron tasks periodically as part of server
responses. You can turn this off and trigger cron from a process outside of the
server. You can check the cron tasks' status in the status report.
