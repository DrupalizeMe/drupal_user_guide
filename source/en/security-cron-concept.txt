==== What is Cron?

Cron is a time-based task scheduler that you can configure to automatically run
periodic tasks like checking for updates, indexing content for search, or
cleaning up log files. Both Drupal core and many contributed modules utilize
Cron.

An action triggered by Cron is called a "cron job".
