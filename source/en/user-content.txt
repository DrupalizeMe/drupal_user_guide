==== Goal

Assign Vendor content items _Happy Farm_ and _Sweet Honey_ to the corresponding
Vendor user accounts, so they can edit their own Vendor profiles on the site.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<user-concept>>

==== Site prerequisites

* The Vendor content type must exist, and your site must have at least two
Vendor content items. See <<structure-content-type>>, <<structure-fields>>, and
<<content-create>>.

* User accounts for at least two vendors must exist. See <<user-new-user>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Content_.

. Find Vendor content item Happy Farm in the list. If it is not immediately
visible, you can filter the list by _Published status_, _Type_ (Vendor), _Title_
or _Language_.  Click _Edit_ for the Vendor content item you would like to
assign an author to.

. Locate the information block and click _Authoring information_.
