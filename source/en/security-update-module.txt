==== Steps

. Check for module-specific update instructions. This is typically necessary
when updating modules that involve the usage of third party libraries. Be sure
to read and understand all module specific requirements before proceeding with
the updates. To find instructions, check the module's project page "Read
Documentation" link, as well as the instructions (for example, _README.txt_,
_INSTALL.txt_, and _UPGRADE.txt_) that come with the module's installation
file. Also review the release notes by clicking on the version number of the
download on the project page for the version you're downloading.

. Back up your database and files. Though unlikely, any operation that modifies
the database can be potentially damaging. It is highly recommended that you
<<prevent-backups,back up your site>> before updating modules.

. Put your site into Maintenance mode.  In the _Manage_ administrative menu,
navigate to _Configuration_ > _Maintenance mode_
(_/admin/config/development/maintenance_). Put the site into maintenance mode by
selecting _Put site into maintenance mode_.

. Replace the module code with the updated version.  You can use any of these
methods to update a module:
+
  * Use the _Update manager_: In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to
  the _Update Manager_ by clicking _Extend_, and then browsing to the _Update_
  tab (_admin/modules/update_).  If there available updates for any enabled
  modules on your site, they will be listed here. To install an update, mark
  the checkbox next to the module(s) you're updating and click _Download these
  updates_.
  * Manually updating files: Download a copy of the new module from the
  drupal.org project page, or navigate to the _Update Manager_ and use the
  link in the module _Name_ column of the updates list. Delete the entire
  outdated module's directory and upload the new one as if you were
  <<extend-module-install,installing the module>> for the first time.
  * Use Drush:
  If you have Drush installed, you can also update your modules from the
  command line.
  +
  To update one or more modules using Drush run the following command from a
  command prompt, where [module] is the drupal.org project name of the module
  you want to update: +drush up [module]+
  +
  If you have more than one module to update, add the additional module project
  names to the end of the command, separated by spaces.
  +
  Note: If you use Drush to update your module, you don't need to run
  update.php, allowing you to skip the next step.

. Run _update.php_, which updates the database after modules, themes, or core
have been updated or upgraded. You can run _update.php_ using a web browser by
going to _http://example.com/update.php_ (replacing example.com with the base
URL of your Drupal site).
+
Performing updates requires the _administer software updates_
<<user-permissions,user permission>>. The first account created on your site
("user 1") will always have the required privileges.
+
Follow the steps through the update utility, and optionally, review the
<<prevent-log,site log>> once the updates are complete to check for errors.

. Turn off Maintenance mode.  Put the site back online by returning to
__/admin/config/development/maintenance_ and disabling maintenance mode.
