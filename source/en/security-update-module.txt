=== Updating a Module

(((Module,updating)))
(((Security update,applying)))
(((Contributed module,updating)))

==== Goal

Update a contributed module and run the _Database Updates_ script.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<security-concept>>
* <<security-cron-concept>>

==== Site prerequisites

* <<extend-module-install, A contributed module has been installed>>
and there is an update available for it.

* <<security-cron, Ensure that cron maintenance tasks are run regularly on
your site>>.

* <<prevent-backups,Back up your site>>. Though unlikely, operations that
modify the database can be damaging.

If you update via the website:

* <<user-admin-account, Login with the User 1 account>>.
* Install the _Update Manager_ module. See <<language-enable>> for
instructions on installing modules.

If you are using Drush to update the module: <<install-tools, Have Drush
installed>>.

==== Steps

Before you start, check for module-specific update instructions. This is
typically necessary when updating modules that involve the usage of third party
libraries. Be sure to read and understand all module specific requirements
before proceeding with the updates. To find instructions, check the module's
project page _Read Documentation_ link, as well as the instructions (for
example, _README.txt_, _INSTALL.txt_, and _UPGRADE.txt_) that come with the
module's installation file. Also review the release notes by clicking on the
version number of the download on the project page for the version you're
downloading.

You can use the website or Drush to update a contributed module. If you are
updating a custom module rather than a contributed module, or if the steps below
do not work to obtain the new module files, follow the steps in
<<extend-manual-install>>, and then continue here with website step 6.

===== Using the website

. Put your site in to <<extend-maintenance, maintenance mode>>.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Configuration_ > _Reports_ >
_Available updates_ > _Update_ (admin/reports/updates/update).

. Select the module.

. Click _Download these updates_.

. Click _Continue_.

. Click _Run database updates_. If you obtained the new module files manually,
start with this step, and reach the database updates page by typing the URL
_example.com/update.php_ in your browser.

. Click _Continue_. The database update scripts will be executed.

. Put your site out of the <<extend-maintenance, maintenance mode>>.

===== Using Drush

. Find the project name for the module you update, which is the last
segment of the module's project page URL. For example, if the project URL is
_https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_toolbar_, the project name is
+admin_toolbar+.

. Run the _up_ command from a command prompt and give the drupal.org
project name (for example, _admin_toolbar_) as a parameter.

----
drush up admin_toolbar
----

[start=3]
. Follow the instructions on the screen.

If you have more than one module to update, add the additional module project
names to the end of the command, separated by spaces.

==== Follow-on tasks

* Review the <<prevent-log,site log>> once the updates are complete to check for
errors.
* <<security-update-theme>>
