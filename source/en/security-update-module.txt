=== Updating a Module

(((Module,updating)))
(((Security update,applying)))
(((Contributed module,updating)))

==== Goal

Update a contributed module and run the _Database Updates_ script.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<security-concept>>
* <<security-cron-concept>>

==== Site prerequisites

* A contributed module has been installed and there is an update available for
it. See <<extend-module-install>> and <<security-announce>>.

* If your site is live, you should test this process in a development
environment before running it on your production site. See
<<install-dev-making>>.

* You have created a full site backup. See <<prevent-backups>>.

* If you want to use the user interface, the core Update Manager module must be
installed. See <<config-install>> for instructions on installing core
modules.

* If you want to use Drush, Drush must be installed. See <<install-tools>>.

==== Steps

Before you start, check for module-specific update instructions. This is
typically necessary when updating modules that involve the usage of third party
libraries. Read and understand all module specific requirements
before proceeding with the updates. To find instructions, check the module's
project page _Read Documentation_ link, as well as the instructions (for
example, _README.txt_, _INSTALL.txt_, and _UPGRADE.txt_) that come with the
module's installation file. Also review the release notes by clicking the
version number of the download on the project page for the version you're
downloading.

You can use the administrative interface or Drush to update a contributed
module. If you are updating a custom module rather than a contributed module, or
if the steps below do not work to obtain the new module files, follow the steps
in <<extend-manual-install>>, and then continue here with administrative
interface step 6.

===== Using the administrative interface

. Put your site in to <<extend-maintenance, maintenance mode>>.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Configuration_ > _Reports_ >
_Available updates_ > _Update_ (_admin/reports/updates/update_).

. Find the module in the list, and click _Download these updates_ for the
module.

. Click _Continue_.

. Click _Run database updates_. If you obtained the new module files manually,
start with this step, and reach the database updates page by typing the URL
_example.com/update.php_ in your browser.

. Click _Continue_. The database update scripts will be executed.

. Put your site out of the <<extend-maintenance, maintenance mode>>.

===== Using Drush

. Find the project name for the module you update, which is the last
segment of the module's project page URL. For example, if the project URL is
_https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_toolbar_, the project name is
+admin_toolbar+.

. Run the _up_ command from a command prompt and give the drupal.org project
name (for example, _admin_toolbar_) as a parameter. If you have more than one
module to update, add the additional module project names to the end of the
command, separated by spaces.

drush up admin_toolbar

[start=3]
. Follow the instructions on the screen.

==== Follow-on tasks

* Review the <<prevent-log,site log>> once the updates are complete to check for
errors.
