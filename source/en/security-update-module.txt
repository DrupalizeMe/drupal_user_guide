=== Updating a Module

(((Security update,applying)))
(((Contributed module,updating)))
(((Drush tool,using to update module)))

==== Goal

Update a contributed module and run the _Database Updates_ script.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<security-concept>>
* <<security-cron-concept>>

==== Site prerequisites

* A contributed module has been installed and there is an update available for
it. See <<extend-module-install>> and <<security-announce>>.

* If your site is live, you should test this process in a development
environment before running it on your production site. See
<<install-dev-making>>.

* You have created a full site backup. See <<prevent-backups>>.

* If you want to use the user interface, the core Update Manager module must be
installed. See <<config-install>> for instructions on installing core
modules.

* If you want to use Drush, Drush must be installed. See <<install-tools>>.

==== Steps

Before you start, check for module-specific update instructions. This is
typically necessary when updating modules that involve the usage of third party
libraries. Read and understand all module specific requirements
before proceeding with the updates. To find instructions, check the module's
project page _Read Documentation_ link.

To view further instructions, download the tar.gz or .zip file from the project
page to your local computer. Unzip the file and look for _README.txt_,
_INSTALL.txt_ and _UPGRADE.txt_ that come with the module's installation
file. Also review the release notes by clicking the version number of the
download on the project page for the version you're downloading.

You can use the administrative interface or Drush to update a contributed
module. If you are updating a custom module rather than a contributed module, or
if the steps below do not work to obtain the new module files, follow the steps
in <<extend-manual-install>>, and then continue here with administrative
interface step 6.

===== Using the administrative interface

. Put your site in to maintenance mode. See <<extend-maintenance>>.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Reports_ >
_Available updates_ > _Update_ (_admin/reports/updates/update_).

. Find and check the module in the list. Click _Download these updates_ for the
module.

. Click _Continue_.

. Click _Run database updates_. If you obtained the new module files manually,
start with this step, and reach the database updates page by typing the URL
_example.com/update.php_ in your browser.

. Click _Continue_ and apply all updates. The database update scripts will be
executed.

. Click _Administration pages_ to return to the administration section of your
site.

. Put your site out of the maintenance mode. See <<extend-maintenance>>.

. Clear the Drupal cache (refer to <<prevent-cache-clear>>).

===== Using Drush

. Find the project name for the module you update, which is the last
segment of the module's project page URL. For example, if the project URL is
_https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_toolbar_, the project name is
`admin_toolbar`.

. Run the following Drush command, giving the project name (for example,
_admin_toolbar_) as a parameter (if you have more than one module to update, add
the additional module project names to the end of the command, separated by
spaces):
+
----
drush up admin_toolbar
----

[start=3]
. Follow the instructions on the screen.

==== Follow-on tasks

* Review the site log (refer to <<prevent-log>>) once the updates are complete
to check for errors.
