==== What is a View mode?

How an entity (such as content, a user or a comment) is displayed, depends on
the context in which it is shown. In Drupal this context is called a _view
mode_. Examples of view modes are:

* a full page of the content with all the field values
* a teaser of the content with a thumbnail image and a _Read more_ link
* a full user profile with a zoomable portrait photo
* an user avatar with username and a link to the profile

Every view mode can be configured through the administration pages of Drupal. To
see the configuration options of the view modes of the _Recipe_ content type,
navigate in the _Manage_ administrative menu to _Structure_ > _Content types_
(admin/structure/types) and choose _Manage display_ from the dropdown button. In
each view mode, each field can be hidden or displayed, and if it is displayed,
you can choose and configure the field formatter.

==== What is a field formatter?

A field formatter is a setting for displaying the field values. For example,
long text fields can be displayed trimmed or full-length, and taxonomy term
reference fields can be displayed in plain text or linked to the taxonomy term
page. Consult the _Manage display_ page to see the field formatters for the
fields of the _Recipe_ content type.
