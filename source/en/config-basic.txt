==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Configuration_ > _System_ >
  _Site information_ (admin/config/system/site-information) to update basic
  settings, such as the _Site name_, _Slogan_, _Email address_ or the
  _Default front page_ path.

. The very first thing which you may like to update is the site name: You can
  enter the desired name of the site in the _Site name_ field (in the
  _Site details_ section).

. The site slogan can be updated by entering the desired text in the _Slogan_
  field.

. The site's administrative email address (which would be used as the 'From'
  address in automated e-mail communications, such as registrations, password
  resets, etc) can be entered in the _Email address_ field.

. Site wide error pages for 403 or 404 errors can be defined in the respective
  fields provided in the _Error pages_ section.
