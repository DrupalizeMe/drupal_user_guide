=== Updating a Theme

(((Theme,updating)))
(((Security update,applying)))
(((Contributed theme,updating)))

==== Goal

Update a contributed theme on your site and run the _Database Updates_ script.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<security-concept>>
* <<security-cron-concept>>

==== Site prerequisites

* A contributed theme has been installed and there is an update available for
it. See <<extend-theme-install>> and <<security-announce>>.

* If your site is live, you should test this process in a development
environment before running it on your production site. See
<<install-dev-making>>.

* You have created a full site backup. See <<prevent-backups>>.

* If you want to use the user interface, the core Update Manager module must be
installed. See <<config-install>> for instructions on installing core
modules.

* If you want to use Drush, Drush must be installed. See <<install-tools>>.

==== Steps

You can use the administrative interface or Drush to update a contributed
theme. If you are updating a custom theme rather than a contributed theme, or if
the steps below do not work to obtain the new theme files, follow the steps in
<<extend-manual-install>>, and then continue here with administrative interface
step 6.

===== Using the administrative interface

. Put your site in to maintenance mode. See <<extend-maintenance>>.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Reports_ >
_Available updates_ > _Update_ (_admin/reports/updates/update_).

. Find the theme in the list, and click _Download these updates_ for the theme.

// To create this image, download and enable and old version of bootstrap with drush: drush dl bootstrap-8.x-3.0-beta1. Then go to admin/reports/updates

. Click _Continue_.

. Click _Run database updates_. If you obtained the new theme files manually,
start with this step, and reach the database updates page by typing the URL
_example.com/update.php_ in your browser.

. Click _Continue_ and apply all updates. The database update scripts will be
executed.

. Click _Administration pages_ to return to the administration section of your
site.

. Put your site out of the maintenance mode. See <<extend-maintenance>>.

. Clear the Drupal cache (refer to <<prevent-cache-clear>>).

===== Using Drush

. Find the project name for the theme you update, which is the last segment of
the theme's project page URL. For example, if the project URL is
_https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap, the project name is `bootstrap`.

. Run the following Drush command, giving the project name (for example,
_bootstrap_) as a parameter:
+
----
drush up bootstrap
----

[start=3]
. Follow the instructions on the screen.

==== Follow-on tasks

* Review the site log, see <<prevent-log>>, once the updates are complete to
check for errors.
