=== Updating a Theme

(((Theme,updating)))
(((Security updates,applying)))
(((Contributed theme,updating)))

==== Goal

Keep your website secure by updating contributed themes when security updates
are announced.

This means you download the updated files and you run the update scripts
supplied by the theme, which could update your database, files, or
configuration. If you do both you ensure that the code stays synchronized with
your site configuration and database.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<security-concept>>
* <<security-cron-concept>>

==== Site prerequisites

* <<extend-theme-install, A custom or contributed theme has been installed>>
and there is an update available for it.

* <<security-cron, Ensure that cron maintenance tasks are run regularly on
your site>>.

* <<prevent-backups,Back up your site>>. Though unlikely, operations that
modify the database can be damaging.

If you update via the website:

* <<user-admin-account, Login with the User 1 account>>.

* The _Update Manager_ module must be installed. See <<language-enable>> for
instructions on installing modules.

If you are using Drush to update the theme:

* <<install-tools, Have Drush installed>>

==== Steps

You can use the website or Drush to update contributed themes.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Configuration_ > _Reports_ >
