=== Updating a Theme

(((Theme,updating)))
(((Security updates,applying)))
(((Contributed theme,updating)))

==== Goal

Keep your website secure by updating contributed themes when security updates
are announced.

This means you download the updated files and you run the update scripts
supplied by the theme, which could update your database, files, or
configuration. If you do both you ensure that the code stays synchronized with
your site configuration and database.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<security-concept>>
* <<security-cron-concept>>

==== Site prerequisites

* <<extend-theme-install, A custom or contributed theme has been installed>>
and there is an update available for it.

* <<security-cron, Ensure that cron maintenance tasks are run regularly on
your site>>.

* <<prevent-backups,Back up your site>>. Though unlikely, operations that
modify the database can be damaging.

If you update via the website:

* <<user-admin-account, Login with the User 1 account>>.

* Install the _Update Manager_ module. See <<language-enable>> for
instructions on installing modules.

If you are using Drush to update the theme: <<install-tools, Have Drush
installed>>.

==== Steps

You can use the website or Drush to update a contributed theme. Alternatively
you can update the theme by <<extend-manual-install, downloading and unpacking
it>>.

===== Using the website

. Put your site in to <<extend-maintenance, maintenance mode>>.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Configuration_ > _Reports_ >
_Available updates_ > _Update_ (admin/reports/updates/update).

. Select the theme.

. Click _Download these updates_.

image:images/security-update-theme-updates.png["Available updates",width="100%"]

[start=5]

. Click _Continue_.

. Click _Run database updates_.

. Click _Continue_. The database update scripts will be executed.

. Put your site out of the <<extend-maintenance, maintenance mode>>.

===== Using Drush

. Find the project name for the theme you update, which is the last segment of
the theme's project page URL. For example, if the project URL is
_https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap, the project name is +bootstrap+.

. Run the _up_ command from a command prompt and give the drupal.org project
name (for example, _bootstrap_) as a parameter.

. Follow the instructions on the screen.

errors.
