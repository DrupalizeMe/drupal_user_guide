=== Updating a Theme

(((Theme,updating)))
(((Security update,applying)))
(((Contributed theme,updating)))

==== Goal

Update a contributed theme on your site and run the _Database Updates_ script.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<security-concept>>
* <<security-cron-concept>>

==== Site prerequisites

* <<extend-theme-install, A custom or contributed theme has been installed>>
and there is an update available for it.

* <<security-cron, Ensure that cron maintenance tasks are run regularly on
your site>>.

* <<prevent-backups,Back up your site>>. Though unlikely, operations that
modify the database can be damaging.

If you update via the website:

* <<user-admin-account, Login with the User 1 account>>.

* Install the _Update Manager_ module. See <<language-enable>> for
instructions on installing modules.

If you are using Drush to update the theme: <<install-tools, Have Drush
installed>>.

==== Steps

You can use the website or Drush to update a contributed theme. If you are
updating a custom theme rather than a contributed theme, or if the steps below
do not work to obtain the new theme files, follow the steps in
<<extend-manual-install>>, and then continue here with website step 6.

===== Using the website

. Put your site in to <<extend-maintenance, maintenance mode>>.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Configuration_ > _Reports_ >
_Available updates_ > _Update_ (_admin/reports/updates/update_).

. Find the theme in the list, and click _Download these updates_ for the theme.

. Click _Continue_.

. Click _Run database updates_. If you obtained the new theme files manually,
start with this step, and reach the database updates page by typing the URL
_example.com/update.php_ in your browser.

. Click _Continue_. The database update scripts will be executed.

. Put your site out of the <<extend-maintenance, maintenance mode>>.

===== Using Drush

. Find the project name for the theme you update, which is the last segment of
the theme's project page URL. For example, if the project URL is
_https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap, the project name is +bootstrap+.

. Run the _up_ command from a command prompt and give the drupal.org project
name (for example, _bootstrap_) as a parameter.

errors.
