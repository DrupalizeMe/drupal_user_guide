//==== Prerequisite knowledge

==== What is a Status Report?

The status report is a short overview of your site's parameters as well as any
problems detected with your installation. It may be useful to copy and paste
this information into support requests filed on drupal.org's support forums and
project issue queues or when asking for help on other channels.

You can find your siteâ€™s status report in the _Manage_ administrative menu under
_Reports_.
