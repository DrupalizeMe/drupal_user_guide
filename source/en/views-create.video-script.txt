=== Creating a Content List View

(Slide/Intro)
This tutorial covers how to create a content list view.

(Slide/Goal)
By the end of this tutorial you'll know how to create a page listing vendors that will be automatically updated whenever a
vendor is added, deleted, or updated on the site.

(Slide/Prerequisites)

Before you get started with this tutorial you'll want to make sure you:

Know what Views are from a conceptual level.
You'll also want to understand the main parts that make up a view.

Your site will need the core Views and Views UI modules installed. These are already installed for you when you use the core Standard installation profile.

Another requirement is to have a vendor content type with URL and main image fields on your site.

See the written version of this tutorial for links to each of these prerequisites if they're unfamiliar to you.

(Demo/Browser)

In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Structure_ > _Views_ > _Add
view_ (_admin/structure/views/add_). The _Add view_ wizard appears.

We'll now fill in the fields that we want to appear in our listing.

The view name will be the label that is applied to this view on the administration pages. We'll use "Vendors".

The type of information that will be shown in this view is Content. Specifically we're going to restrict our view to Vendor content items.

We'll also specify that we're going to sort our vendor itmes by their Title.

Now we're ready to move on to the page settings. We're going to create a page to display our view with the title "Vendors". We'll also use "vendors" for the path this page will be available at.

On our page we'll diplay a table listing, with 10 items visible per page. We'll also make sure that we've enabled a pager so that users can browse our complete list of vendors.

We'll create a menu link, adding our view listing to the Main navigation menu also with the title "Vendors".

With our basic view settings properly configured we can now click _Save and edit_. This will take us to the full view configuration page. Now we're ready to specify which fields will actually appear in our table listing.

. Under _Fields_, click _Add_ from the dropdown button. The _Add fields_ pop-up
appears.

. Enter the word "image" in the search field.

. Check Main image in the table.

. Click _Apply_. The _Configure field: Content: Main Image_
pop-up appears.

We'll configure this image field by removing the label value, using the Medium image style, and ensuring the image links to the content item.

. Click _Apply_. The view configuration page appears.

. Under _Fields_, click _Add_ from the dropdown button. The _Add fields_ pop-up
appears.

. Enter the word "body" in the search field.

. Select _Body_ in the table.

. Click _Apply_. The _Configure field: Content: Body_ pop-up
appears.

We'll configure the body field by removing the label value, making sure the formatter is set to display the Summary or a trimmed value, and set the trimmed limit to a 120 character maximum.

. Click _Apply_. The view configuration page appears.

. Under _Fields_, click _Content: Title (Title)_. The _Configure field: Content:
Title_ pop-up appears.

. Uncheck _Create a label_. This will remove the label that was created by the
wizard.

. Click _Apply_. The view configuration page appears.

. Under _Fields_, click _Rearrange_ in the dropdown button. The _Rearrange
fields_ pop-up appears.

. Drag the fields into the right order: Image, Title, Body.

. Click _Apply_. The view configuration page appears.

. Optionally, click _Update preview_ for a preview.

. Click _Save_.

. Navigate to the homepage and click Vendors from the main navigation to see
the result.
