=== Clearing the Cache

(((Cache,clearing)))
(((Cache,rebuild)))


==== Goal

Clear, or rebuild, Drupal's internal caches in order to ensure that all items in
them are up-to-date with the most recent data using either the UI, or Drush.


==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<prevent-cache>>
* <<install-tools>>


//==== Site prerequisites


==== Steps

To clear the cache via the UI:

. Navigate to the "Performance" page
  (admin/config/development/performance) from the "Configuration" page.

. Click the button labled "Clear all caches".

. Once the cache has been cleared you should see a success message at the top of
  the page with the text, "Caches cleared.".

Alternately, to clear the cache with Drush you can use one of two commands:

. Use the command `drush cache-rebuild` to clear, and rebuild, all cached data
  for a site. After running this command you should see the output "Cache
  rebuild complete."

. Or, use the command `drush cc` to see a list of individual caches and then
  choose the specific cache you would like to clear. Running this command should
  produce output like the following:

----
> drush cc
Enter a number to choose which cache to clear.
 [0]  :  Cancel
 [1]  :  drush
 [2]  :  theme-registry
 [3]  :  menu
 [4]  :  css-js
 [5]  :  block
 [6]  :  module-list
 [7]  :  theme-list
 [8]  :  render
 [9]  :  views
----

[start=3]
. Choose a cache to clear by entering the number associated with that cache and
  hitting Enter to continue.
