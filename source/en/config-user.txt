=== Configuring User Account Settings

(((User account setting,configuring)))
(((Account setting,configuring)))

==== Goal

For security reasons it may be advised to turn off the (default) ability for the
site's visitors to create their user accounts themselves. In this example we set
user account registration as administrators-only. Then we check the email
messages generated upon account related events.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

<<config-overview>>

//==== Site prerequisites

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Configuration_ > _People_ >
_Account settings_ (_admin/config/people/accounts_).

. In Registration and cancellation, (in this example) select _Administrators
only_ as for who can register user accounts. Leaving the self-registered
users' email verification requirement enabled is superfluous now, however best
to leave it _on_ in case we would change the settings for account registration
later on.

. Below you can provide an email address from which user account notifications
of our farmers' market website will be sent. This is recommended for keeping the
workflow clear, especially if it is not the site's creator who will be engaged
with its users and content.

. In the _Emails_ section below we find the user account related events to
which automated emails can be coupled. This list cannot be extended and only 3
can be disabled via its checkbox: activation, blocking and cancellation.
Templates are given with the core installation. However, you can send
out your own text, for example welcoming our new vendors for whom we just
created accounts. At each email-occasion there is a list of available
variables which will brand and personalize the text.
