==== Goal

Turn off the ability for people to register for user accounts on the site. Also,
review and/or edit the email messages generated by the site for events related
to user accounts.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

//==== Site prerequisites

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Configuration_ > _People_ >
_Account settings_ (_admin/config/people/accounts_).

. In Registration and cancellation, (in this example) select _Administrators
only_ as for who can register user accounts. Leaving the self-registered
users' email verification requirement enabled is superfluous now, however
leave it _on_ in case you want to change the settings for account registration
later on.

. Optionally, change the default email address from which user account
notifications of the farmers' market website will be sent. This will keep
the workflow clear, especially if it is not the site's creator who
will be engaged with its users and content.

. Optionally, edit the email templates in the _Emails_ section to customize
automated emails. You will find account related events to which automated emails
can be coupled. This list cannot be extended and only 3 can be disabled via its
checkbox: activation, blocking and cancellation. Templates are given with the
core installation. However, you can send out your own text, for example
welcoming the new vendors for whom accounts were just created. At each
email-occasion there is a list of available variables which will brand and
personalize the text.
