. To further evaluate a theme, click on its title in the list of search results
  to visit its project page. Some aspects to pay attention to when evaluating
  themes:

* Introduction: The description of the theme on its project page should be clear
  and useful. A screenshot of the theme helps your evaluation as well.
* Releases: The theme should be available for your version of Drupal. Pay
  attention to the color-coding: Themes marked with green are recommended to be
  used on live sites, the ones marked with yellow should be carefully evaluated
  before use, and the ones marked with red are only recommended for testing.
* Project information: Check the theme's maintenance and development status, and
  how frequently it's downloaded and installed.
* Issues: See if there are any open issues, potential problems with the theme.
* Resources: Check if the theme has documentation.
