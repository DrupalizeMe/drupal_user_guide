// ==== Prerequisite knowledge

==== What are text formats?

Text formats change how HTML tags and other text will be processed and displayed
in the site. They are used to transform text, and also help to defend your
website against potentially damaging input from malicious users, like for
example cross-site scripting. By default the site has the text formats _Basic
HTML_, _Restricted HTML_, and _Full HTML_. When using the _Basic HTML_ and
_Restricted HTML_ formats, only a limited set of HTML tags are allowed. The user
input is stored in the database but the not-allowed HTML tags are removed when
displaying the input.

==== What is cross-site scripting?

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability typically found in
websites. In a site that is not well protected, malicious users can enter script
into web pages that are viewed by other users, for example in a comment or in
the body of a page. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by
attackers to login as another user. It is important to configure the Text
Formats of your website to prevent such abuse.
