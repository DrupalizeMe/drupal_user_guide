==== What is a content entity?

A _content entity_ (or commonly, just _entity_) is an item of content data,
which can consist of text, HTML markup, images, attached files, and other data
that is intended to be displayed to site visitors.
Content entities are grouped into _entity types_, which have different purposes
and are displayed in very different ways on the site. Most entity
types are also divided into _entity sub-types_, which are divisions within an
entity type to allow for smaller variations in how the entities are used and
displayed. Here is a table of some common content entity types:

|=============================================
|Entity type |Entity sub-type |Main uses |Examples

|Content item |Content type
  |Content intended to be the main page area for pages on the site
  |In the farmers market site example, you might have content types for
   basic pages, vendor pages, and recipe pages.

|Comment |Comment type
  |Commentary added to content entities (typically to Content item entities)
  |On a blog site, blog posts might have comments. They are not needed in the
   farmers market site example.

|User profile |(none)
  |Data related to a person with a user account (login access) on the site
  |Every site has at least basic user profiles with user names and email
   addresses; social networking sites may have more complex user profiles with
   more information.

|Custom block |Block type
  |Text and images in smaller chunks, often displayed in the site header,
   footer, or sidebar
  |In the farmers market site example, you might put the hours and location in
   a sidebar block.

|Taxonomy term |Vocabulary
  |Used to classify other types of content
  |In the farmers market site example, you might classify Recipe content with an
   Ingredients taxonomy vocabulary, with taxonomy terms like Carrots and
   Tomatoes. In a blogging site, blog posts might be classified using a Tags
   vocabulary, and perhaps also a Categories vocabulary.

|File |(none)
  |An image or attachment file that is tracked and managed by the site, often
   attached to other types of content
  |In the farmers market site example, both Recipe and Vendor pages might have
   image attachments, which would (behind the scenes) be managed as File
   entities by the site

|=============================================

==== What is a field?

Within entity items, the data is stored in individual _fields_, each of which
holds one type of data, such as formatted or plain text, images or other files,
or dates. Fields are specified on entity sub-types, so that all entity items of
a given entity sub-type have the same collection of fields available. For
example, the Vendor content type in the farmers market example might have fields
for the vendor name, a logo image, website URL, and description, whereas the
Basic page content type might only have fields for the title and page body. When
you create or edit entity items, you are specifying the values for the fields on
the entity item.
