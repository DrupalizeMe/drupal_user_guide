=== Assigning Permissions to a Role

(((Permissions,changing)))
(((Permissions,granting)))
(((Permissions,denying)))

==== Goal

By changing the permissions for a role you can grant or deny users the right
to perform particular actions on the website.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<user-concept>>
* <<user-new-role>>
* <<user-roles>>

==== Site prerequisites

* At least one role exists
  <<user-roles>>

==== Steps

. Select the Roles tab on the People page (admin/people/roles). You will see a
  list of all the roles that exist on the website.

. From the drop button choose "Edit permissions" for the role whose
  permissions you would like to change. The permissions page will show all the
  available actions for the website such as, for example, "post comments" or
  "Use advanced search". The available permissions depend on the modules that
  are enabled in the site.

. Select the permissions that you wish to grant to a particular role and
  uncheck the permissions that you wish to deny to a particular role.

. Click "Save permissions" in the bottom of the page to save the changes.
