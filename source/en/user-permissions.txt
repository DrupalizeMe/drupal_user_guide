=== Assigning Permissions to a Role

==== Goal

By changing the permissions for a role you can grant or deny users the right
to perform particular actions on the website.

You give the _Vendor_ role the permissions to create Recipes, edit own Recipes
and Vendor content items, delete own Recipes, use personal contact forms (so
vendors can contact each other), use Restricted HTML text filter and access in
place editing.

==== Site prerequisites

The site needs to have a _Vendor_ role. See <<user-roles>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _People_ and then the _Roles_
tab (admin/people/roles). The _Roles_ page appears.

. Select the _Edit permissions_ option in the drop down for the _Vendor_
role. The _Edit role_ page appears where you show can see all the available
actions for the website such as, for example, _Post comments_ or _Use advanced
search_. The available permissions depend on the modules that are enabled in the
site. Note: some permissions may have security implications, be cautious when
when assigning permissions to roles.

. Check the permissions:
+
  * Recipe: Create new content
  * Recipe: Edit own content
  * Recipe: Delete own content
  * Vendor: Edit own content
  * Use users' personal contact forms
  * Use the Restricted HTML text format
  * Access in-place editing

. Click _Save permissions_ in the bottom of the page to save the changes.

==== Follow-on tasks

You can grant or deny users the right to perform particular actions by
assigning roles to, or removing roles from users. <<user-roles>>
