==== Goal

Change the permissions for the _Vendor_ role so that users can create, edit,
and delete recipe and vendor content, format the content, and contact each
other.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<user-concept>>
* <<user-new-role>>
* <<user-roles>>

==== Site prerequisites

The Vendor role must exist on your site. See <<user-new-role>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _People_ and then the _Roles_
tab (_admin/people/roles_). The _Roles_ page appears.

. Click _Edit permissions_ in the dropdown for the _Vendor_
role. The _Edit role_ page appears where you show can see all the available
actions for the website such as, for example, _Post comments_ or _Use advanced
search_. The available permissions depend on the modules that are installed in
the site. Note: some permissions may have security implications, be cautious
when when assigning permissions to roles.

. Check the permissions:
+
  * Recipe: Create new content
  * Recipe: Edit own content
  * Recipe: Delete own content
  * Vendor: Edit own content
  * Use users' personal contact forms
  * Use the Restricted HTML text format
  * Access in-place editing

. Click _Save permissions_ in the bottom of the page to save the changes.
