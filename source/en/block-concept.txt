==== What is a block?

*Blocks* are individual pieces of your site's web page layout. Blocks are
placed inside the <<block-regions,regions>> of your theme, and can be
created, removed, and rearranged from the "Block layout" administration page.
Examples of blocks include the "Who's online" listing, the main navigation
menu, and the breadcrumb trail. The main page content is also a block.

Some modules make new blocks available for placement on your site. For
example, when the Search module is enabled, it provides a block that contains
a search form. You may also create and place your own custom blocks.

Each block has its own configuration settings, which allow you to select
which pages of your site will display the block. It is even possible to place
multiple copies of a block, each with its own separate configuration and
visibility rules.
