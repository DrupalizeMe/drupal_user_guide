==== Steps

Installing a theme involves downloading the required file from drupal.org,
expanding the archive file, and then placing the resulting directory and all the
files into the _themes/_ directory in the root of your project. You can
optionally add a subdirectory, _themes/contrib/_, which is recommended in order
to keep themes downloaded from drupal.org separate from any custom themes. Then,
you need to enable the theme from within your site.

If you have the Update Manager module installed, the first part (download,
expand, upload) can be done automatically. Here are the steps:

. After locating a theme on drupal.org copy the link for the .tar.gz download of
  the theme that you want to install.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu on your site, navigate to _Appearance_
  (admin/theme) and then click the _Install new theme_ button
  (admin/theme/install).

. Paste the link to the .tar.gz file for the theme you want to install into the
  _Install from a URL_ field. Then click the _Install_ button.

// Go to page where you can copy/paste a link for installing a theme and
// screenshot the form on that page.

. This will take you to the _Update manager_ which will download the theme and
  display a success message. The message should read _Installation was completed
  successfully._, and underneath it will list the theme you've just installed.

// with the update manager.

[start=5]
. Under _Next steps_ click the _Install newly added themes_ link. This will take
  you back to the _Appearance_ page (admin/appearance) in the _Manage_
  administrative menu.

// Screenshot of the appearance page, with newly added theme ready to be
// installed.

[start=6]
. If you didn't use the _Update manager_, and instead downloaded the theme
  manually you can start with this step.

  Any themes which have been download, but not yet installed, are listed under
  the _Unisntalled themes_. To enable the new theme click the _Install and set
  as default_ link. This will enable the new theme, and display a message
  letting you know it is now the default theme.

. All non-administrative pages on the site will now use this new theme.
