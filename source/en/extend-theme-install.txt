==== Goal

Download and install a theme from Drupal.org.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

<<extend-theme-find>>

==== Site prerequisites

If you install via the website: have the _Update Manager_ module installed. See
<<language-enable>> for instructions on installing modules.

If you are using Drush to install the theme: <<install-tools, Have Drush
installed>>.

==== Steps

You can use the website or Drush to install a contributed theme. Alternatively
you can install the theme by <<extend-manual-install, downloading and
unpacking it>>.

===== Using the website

. On the theme's project page on drupal.org (for example,
https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap) scroll to the _Downloads_ section
in the bottom of the page.

. Right click the _tar.gz_ download link and copy the address.

// For this screenshot got https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap and
// crop to the downloads section. Highlight the tar.gz link.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Appearance_ (admin/themes).
The _Appearance_ page appears.

. Click _Install new theme_. The _Install new theme_ page appears.

. In the field _Install from a URL_ paste the copied download link. This value
could look like
`https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/bootstrap-8.x-3.0-beta3.tar.gz`

// Go to page where you can copy/paste a link for installing a theme and
// screenshot the form on that page.

[start=6]
. Click _Install_ to upload and unpack the new theme on the server. The files
are being downloaded to the _themes_ folder.

. Select _Install newly added themes_ to return to the _Appearance_ page.

. Locate the new theme and click _Install and set as default_ to use it. All
non-administrative pages on the site will now use this new theme.

// Screenshot of the appearance page, with newly added theme ready to be
// installed.

===== Using Drush

. Find the project name for the theme you want to install, which is the last
segment of the theme's project page URL. For example, if the project URL is
_https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap, the project name is +bootstrap+.

. Run the _dl_, _en_ and _config-set_ commands from a command prompt and give
the drupal.org project name (for example, _bootstrap_) as a parameter.

----
drush dl bootstrap
drush en bootstrap
drush config-set system.theme default bootstrap
