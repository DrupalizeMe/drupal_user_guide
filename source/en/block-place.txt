==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Structure_ > _Block layout_
(_admin/structure/block_). The _Block layout_ page appears, listing the theme's
regions.

. Ensure that in the secondary tab the core Bartik theme is selected. Block
placement is defined per theme.

. Locate the region _Sidebar second_ in the list and click _Place block_ next to
it. The _Place block_ window appears, listing all the blocks.

. Locate the block Opening hours and location and click _Place block_ next to
it. The _Configure block_ window appears. Fill in the fields as shown below.

This configuration allows you also to hide or display the block on specific
pages. In the case of the Farmer's market website you do not set any of these
configuration options because you want to show the block everywhere.
