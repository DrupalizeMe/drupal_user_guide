==== What are Distributions?

Distributions provide site features and functions for a specific type of site as
a single download containing Drupal core, contributed modules, themes, and
pre-defined configuration. They make it possible to set up a complex,
use-specific site in fewer steps than installing and configuring elements
individually.

There are two main types of Drupal Distributions:

Full-featured Distributions::
  All-inclusive products providing complete solutions for specialized use
  cases. With a 'full-featured' Distribution, you can quickly and easily set up
  a site for a specialized purpose such as academic, business, government,
  nonprofit, publishing, social, etc. For example you could use a Distribution
  created for farmers markets if there is one available, or you could share your
  set-up for the farmers market site as a Distribution for others to use.
Other Distributions:: Quick-start tools developers and site builders can use as
  a starting point.
