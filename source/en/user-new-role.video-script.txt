Slide (title): In this tutorial, we'll walk through how to create a new role.

Slide (goal): By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how to create a new Vendor role to allow some but not all users to perform specific tasks.

Slide (prereq): To follow along, you should understand the concept of users, roles, and permissions. See the written version of this tutorial for links to these concept tutorials.

Demo:

1. In the Manage administrative menu, navigate to People > Roles, which is the path admin/people/roles.
2. Here we will find the default roles Anonymous user, Authenticated user, and Administrator already present.
3. Click Add Role to add a custom role.
4. Type Vendor in the Role name field. Click Save.
5. Now we can see the message "Role Vendor has been added." displayed at the top of the page.
6. This role is now ready to be configured with permissions.

Slide (recap): In this tutorial, we created a new Vendor role that is ready to be configured with permissions and assigned to a user.
