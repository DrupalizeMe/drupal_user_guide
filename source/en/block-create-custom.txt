cached. You can either wait for the cache to be refreshed or open the
_Performance_ page via Configuration > Performance
(admin/config/development/performance) and click _Clear all caches._

navigate to _Structure_ > _Block layout_ > _Custom block library_
(admin/structure/block/block-content), find your block in the list and click the
edit link to make changes.
