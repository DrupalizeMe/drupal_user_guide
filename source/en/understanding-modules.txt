==== What is a module?

A module is a set of PHP, JavaScript, and/or CSS files that extends site
features and adds functionality. You can turn the features and functionality on
by _installing_ the module, and you can turn it off by _uninstalling_ the
module; before uninstalling, you may need to remove data and configuration
related to the feature or functionality. Each module that is installed adds to
the time needed to generate pages on your site, so it is a good idea to
uninstall modules that are not needed.

The core download provides modules for functionality such as:

* Managing user accounts (the User module)

* Managing basic content (the Node module) and fields (the Field, Field UI, and
various specific field modules)

* Managing navigation menus (the Menu UI module)

* Making lists, grids, and blocks from existing content (the Views and Views UI
modules)

You can download additional _contributed modules_ from the
https://www.drupal.org/project/modules[_Drupal.org_ Module Downloads], or create your own
_custom modules_.
