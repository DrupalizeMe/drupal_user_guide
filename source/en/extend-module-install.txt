==== Goal
Download and install the contributed _Admin toolbar_ module, which allows you to
easily browse through the administration section of the website.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<understanding-modules>>
* <<extend-module-find>>

==== Site prerequisites

If you install via the website: have the _Update Manager_ module installed. See
<<language-enable>> for instructions on installing modules.

If you are using Drush to install the module, <<install-tools, have Drush
installed>>.

==== Steps

You can use the website or Drush to install a contributed module. If you are
installing a custom module rather than a contributed module, or if the steps
below do not work to download and unpack the module files, follow the steps in
<<extend-manual-install>>, and then continue here with website step 7.

===== Using the website

. On the _Admin toolbar_ project page on drupal.org
(https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_toolbar) scroll to the _Downloads_ section
in the bottom of the page.

. Right click the _tar.gz_ download link and copy the address.

// For this screenshot got https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_toolbar and
// crop to the downloads section. Highlight the tar.gz link.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Extend_ (admin/modules). The
_Extend_ page appears.

. Click _Install new module_. The _Install new module_ page appears.

. In the field _Install from a URL_ paste the copied download link. This value
could look like
`https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/admin_toolbar-8.x-1.14.tar.gz`
+
// For this screenshot follow steps 1 - 3

. Click _Install_ to upload and unpack the new module on the server. The files
are being downloaded to the _modules_ directory.

. Select _Enable newly added modules_ to return to the _Extend_ page. If you
used the manual uploading procedure, start with this step, and reach the
_Extend_ page by navigating: in the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to
_Extend_ (admin/modules).

. Locate and select the module _Admin toolbar_.

. Click _Install_ to turn on the new module.

===== Using Drush

. Find the project name for the module you want to install, which is the last
segment of the module's project page URL. For example, if the project URL is
_https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_toolbar_, the project name is
+admin_toolbar+.

. Run the _dl_ and _en_ commands from a command prompt and give the drupal.org
project name (for example, _admin_toolbar_) as a parameter.

----
drush dl admin_toolbar
drush en admin_toolbar

[start=3]
. Follow the instructions on the screen.

==== Follow-on tasks

* Verify that the _Admin toolbar_ module is working by browsing through the menu
in the administration section.

* Install and configure the contributed Pathauto module so that content pages in
your site get automatic nice URLs. See <<content-paths>> for more on URLs.
