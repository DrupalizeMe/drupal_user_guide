=== Audience and Goal

This guide was written mainly for people with minimal knowledge of the Drupal
content management system who would like to become skilled at installing,
administering, site building, and/or maintaining the content of a Drupal-based
website. The guide is also aimed at people who already have some experience
with a current or past version of Drupal, and want to expand the range of their
skills and knowledge or update them to the current version.

Depending on which aspects of Drupal you would like to learn, you will need some
background knowledge to understand this guide: general Internet skills and
knowledge are assumed, and the guide concentrates on Drupal itself. For
instance, the sections about installing Drupal on a web server assume you can
obtain web hosting and figure out how to transfer files to your chosen web host.
Similarly, the sections about content management assume you can log into a
website and fill in a web-based form.

After reading this guide you should be able to:

* Plan the content architecture for a Drupal-based site

* Build the site that you planned

* Manage and administer your site

* Understand documentation and blog posts on topics not covered here, to
expand your knowledge and skills

* Connect with the worldwide Drupal community
