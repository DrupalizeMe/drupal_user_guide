==== What are forms and widgets?

The content management system software that your site is running allows
administrators to edit content and configure settings online, using various web
_forms_. In particular, _content editing forms_ are used to edit your site's
content, and they are configurable by administrators; settings configuration
forms are provided by modules and cannot themselves be configured.

The data in your site's content is stored in one or more fields that are
attached to the content type and/or sub-type. When you configure the content
editing form for each content sub-type, you can:

* Select a _widget_ for each field. A widget defines the method used to enter
the data for the field. For example, a taxonomy term can be chosen using
an autocomplete field, a select list, or a tags-style field that lets editors
add new tags automatically.

* Configure widget settings. For example, you can choose the size of a
plain-text entry field.

* Hide one or more fields from the editing form.

* Reorder the fields.

In principle, you can also have multiple content editing forms available for
each content sub-type. This feature is rarely used, however; the only exception
in common use is for the user profile fields: you can use different forms for
user registration and user editing. For example, you might have a limited set of
fields shown when users first register on the site, and more fields shown later
on when they edit their profiles.
