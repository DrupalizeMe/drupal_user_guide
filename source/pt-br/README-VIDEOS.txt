When videos are embedded in a guide page the video producer must provide
instructions for downloading the translatable caption file, translating, and
providing translations so they can be added to the video.

The following is a list of video producers and instructions for translating
captions from each.

Drupalize.Me
------------

https://drupalize.me

Captions for all videos produced by Drupalize.Me are provided in English and can
be translated to other languages using dotsub (https://dotsub.com). Instructions
for how to use dotsub to translate files can be found here:
  https://drupalize.me/blog/201210/crowd-sourced-subtitles-free-drupal-videos
You may also use a tool of your choice for translating the captions; as long as
they can be exported and provided to us in SRT format we can incorporate them.
If you would like to use another tool please get in touch with us at
info@drupalize.me so we can incorporate your translations.

English, and any existing translated, captions can be downloaded from
  https://dotsub.com/view/user/drupalizeme
Choose the video you would like to retrieve captions for and then use the
download tool on the resulting page.
