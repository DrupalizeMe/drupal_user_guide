==== Goal

Update a contributed theme on your site and run the _Database Updates_ script.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<security-concept>>
* <<security-cron-concept>>

==== Site prerequisites

* A contributed theme has been installed and there is an update available for
it. See <<extend-theme-install>> and <<security-announce>>.

* If your site is live, you should test this process in a development
environment before running it on your production site. See
<<install-dev-making>>.

* You have created a full site backup. See <<prevent-backups>>.

* If you want to use the user interface, the core Update Manager module must be
installed. See <<config-install>> for instructions on installing core
modules.

==== Steps

You can use the administrative interface to update a contributed theme. If you
are updating a custom theme rather than a contributed theme, if you see a
message saying _Installing modules and themes requires FTP access to your
server_, or if the steps below do not work to obtain the new theme files, follow
the steps in <<extend-manual-install>>, and then continue with step 6 in the
instructions for administrative interface below.

If you are using Composer to manage the files in your site, follow the steps
in <<install-composer>> to update the files, then continue here with step 6 in
the instructions for the administrative interface below.

===== Using the administrative interface

. Put your site in maintenance mode. See <<extend-maintenance>>.

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Reports_ >
_Available updates_ > _Update_ (_admin/reports/updates/update_).

. Find and check the theme in the list. Click _Download these updates_ for the
theme.

. Click _Continue_.

. Click _Run database updates_. If you obtained the new theme files manually,
start with this step, and reach the database updates page by typing the URL
_example.com/update.php_ in your browser.

. Click _Continue_ to run the updates. The database update scripts will be
executed.

. Click _Administration pages_ to return to the administration section of your
site.

. Take your site out of maintenance mode. See <<extend-maintenance>>.

. Clear the Drupal cache (refer to <<prevent-cache-clear>>).


==== Expand your understanding

* Review the site log, see <<prevent-log>>, once the updates are complete to
check for errors.
