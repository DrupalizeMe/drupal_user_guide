in the top-level menu.

. If you want to download just the core software, click the _Download Drupal
zip_ or _download tar.gz_ link, and save the file to your local machine.

. If you want to download a distribution, click the _Distributions_ icon or
link, choose a distribution from the list, click through to its project page,
and click the link to download a zip or tar.gz file to your local machine. The
link looks like this:

. Upload the downloaded file to your hosting account. Log in to the control
panel and navigate to the _HTML_ directory. Save the file there.

. Uncompress the tar.gz or zip file, which will create a new directory. If you
do not have terminal access, or your hosting server is not running Linux, your
hosting control panel's file manager should provide a way to extract the
files. If you have terminal access to your hosting server (running Linux), you
can use a command like:
+
----
tar -xzf drupal-8.3.2.tar.gz
----

. Delete the compressed file from the server, unless your unpacking method
already deleted it.

. Rename the directory or reconfigure your web hosting, so that the directory
name matches the directory your web hosting is configured to use for your site.

==== Expand your understanding

Once you have the software downloaded, you can install a temporary demo site
(see <<install-decide>>) by running the following command from the top-level
directory of the core software:

----
php core/scripts/drupal quick-start standard
----

The demo site will be installed, and your web browser should open to log in to
the new site, which will only run as long as the PHP command is active. To learn
more about this functionality, use its help command:

----
php core/scripts/drupal quick-start --help
----
