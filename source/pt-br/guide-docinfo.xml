This guide was written mainly for people with minimal knowledge of the Drupal
content management system. The topics will help them become skilled at
installing, administering, site building, and/or maintaining the content of a
Drupal-based website. The guide is also aimed at people who already have some
experience with a current or past version of Drupal, and want to expand the
range of their skills and knowledge or update them to the current version.
