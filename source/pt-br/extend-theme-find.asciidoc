|================================
|Field name |Explanation |Example value
|Maintenance status |How actively is the theme maintained? If a theme is actively
 maintained, you can expect bug fixes and improvements on a regular basis.
 |Actively maintained
|Development status |What kind of development is the theme undergoing? If you
 select _Under active development_, you can expect new features to be added, and
 some aspects may still change. If you select _Maintenance fixes only_, it means
 that the theme is considered complete. |Any
|Core compatibility |The Drupal version the theme is compatible with.|8.x

 gone through an approval process, but they can still be in development.|Full projects
|Stability | Whether or not the project maintainer has created a production-ready

. To further evaluate a theme, click its title in the list of search results
to visit its project page.

Some aspects to pay attention to while evaluating themes:

* Introduction: The description of the theme on its project page should be clear
and useful. A screenshot of the theme helps your evaluation as well.

* Project information: There may be warnings in this area of the page, such as
if a theme is no longer being developed, or is not covered by the security
advisory policy.

* Project information > Reported installs, downloads: You can see how many
people have downloaded and how many sites use the theme.

* Issues: See if there are any open issues, potential problems with the
theme. Check the Statistics to see how regularly issues are responded to.

* Documentation, Resources: Check if the theme has documentation or a README
file, that can help you install, configure, explore, and test it.
