=== Reporting Problems
[role="summary"]
How to report an issue with this guide (with detailed steps).

==== Goal

Report a problem with this guide, such as:

* Information that is incorrect or does not follow best practices
* Steps that do not work
* Screen shots or text that doesn't match what you see on the screen
* Unclear writing
* Places where a table or screen shot would help clarify the text
* Failure to define terminology
* Missing knowledge prerequisites or site prerequisites for a topic
* Typographical, spelling, grammar, or formatting errors
* Broken links

// ==== Prerequisite knowledge

// ==== Site prerequisites

==== Steps

. Make a note of the topic or topics that contain the problem you have found.

. Log in to https://www.drupal.org[_Drupal.org_] (you will need to create a user
account if you do not already have one).

. Visit the https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/user_guide[User Guide issues
page on _Drupal.org_].

. Verify that the problem you found has not already been reported in another
issue:
  * If there are only a few open issues, scan the _Summary_ column to see if
  any of their descriptions match the problem you found. You may also need to
  read some of the issues to make sure, which you can do by clicking the links
  in the _Summary_ column.
  * If the open issue list is long, enter either a keyword related to the
  problem you found or the title of the topic where the problem occurs in the
  _Search for_ box, and click _Search_ to reduce the issue list. Then either
  scan the summaries or read the issues to see if they match your problem.

. If you determine that your problem has not already been reported, click
_Create a new issue_, and fill in the issue report as follows:

  * If you read the guide on a website, a link to the page or pages
    with the problem

asked for clarification, respond by adding a comment to the issue.
