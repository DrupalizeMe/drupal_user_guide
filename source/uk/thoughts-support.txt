==== Where can you find support?

The Drupal project is open-source, so if you have questions about or problems
with the software, your options for finding answers and fixes are somewhat
different from what they would be for commercial software.

There are several options for free support provided by community
volunteers. First, some IRC channels, local groups, and language communities
encourage support questions, through on-line chat, in-person meetings, or
websites (find out more about these on <<thoughts-connecting>>).

Second, some (but not all) contributed module, distribution, and theme projects
encourage you to post support requests in issues. Generally, projects that have
a very large number of users do not allow support requests in their issues
(Drupal Core is in that category), while projects with a smaller number of users
welcome the occasional support question. Be respectful of developer time and
read the documentation for the project before posting a question in an issue. On
the other hand, all projects encourage you to use issues to report problems and
bugs; see <<thoughts-connecting>> to learn more about that.

In addition to those resources, the following sites provide free forums where
volunteers answer support questions about Drupal:

* The https://www.drupal.org/forum[_Drupal.org_ Forums]
* https://drupal.stackexchange.com/["Drupal Answers" on StackExchange]

If you prefer to pay for support (presumably in exchange for more extensive
service or better availability), you can find service providers in the
https://www.drupal.org/drupal-services["Drupal Marketplace" on _Drupal.org_].
