The images in this directory are mostly automated screen captures, generated by
software in the auto_screenshots directory of this project. More information is
in a README.txt file in that directory.

A few images could not be generated by automatic screen capture. Here is a list
of the manually-generated images (in order by topic appearance in the guide):

Cover image: coverimg.png -- the SVG source for this image is in the "assets"
directory of this project and is called coverimage.svg. You will need to edit
that file, translate the text "User Guide", then export to PNG.

Running the installer (topic install-run.txt): You will need to run the standard
installer, choosing your language, and take a screenshot of each step. Images:
- install-run-1.png -- Select language
- install-run-2.png -- Select profile (Standard)
- install-run-3.png -- Database
- install-run-4.png -- Installation in progress
- install-run-5.png -- Site configuration
- install-run-6.png -- Site installed configuration

Screen shot of vertical toolbar menu configuration (topic config-overview.txt).
To make this screenshot, install Drupal in your language using the Standard
installation profile, log in as an administrator, change the Toolbar to vertical
alignment, expand the Reports section, and take a screenshot of the vertical
toolbar menu. Trim it down to 228x540 pixels:

Editing with the In-Place Editor (topic content-in-place-edit.txt). To make
these screenshots, install Drupal with the Standard install profile, and create
an About page with text translated from the English version. Follow the
instructions in the topic to enable in-place editing, and take similar
screenshots.

Suggested file directory structure for /modules directory (topic
extend-manual-install.txt). To make this screenshot, make a folder called
"drupal" on your computer, and a "modules" subdirectory. Within that, make
subdirectories "contrib" and "custom" (with these translated into your own
language -- if you don't want to translate them, you can just use the English
version of the image). Take a screenshot of this folder structure, and crop to
174 pixels wide:
