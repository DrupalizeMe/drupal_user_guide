==== Goal

Add a block display to the Recipes view to display the most recent recipes
in a sidebar, and change its configuration without changing the existing
Recipes page view.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<views-concept>>
* <<views-parts>>
* <<views-create>>

==== Site prerequisites

* The Recipe content type must exist, it must have a Main image field, and your
site must have a couple of Recipe content items. See <<structure-content-type>>,
<<structure-fields>>, <<structure-form-editing>>, and <<content-create>>.

* The _Thumbnail (100x100)_ image style must be defined. This is created on your
site when you install the core Image module (installed with the core Standard
installation profile) but can be recreated if deleted. See
<<structure-image-style-create>>.

* The Recipes view must exist. See <<views-create>> and <<views-duplicate>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Structure_ > _Views_
(_admin/structure/views_). Find the view "Recipes" and click _Edit_ from its
dropdown button. Alternatively, navigate to the Recipes page in the main site
navigation, and click the _Edit view_ contextual link in the main area of the
page. See <<config-overview>> for information about contextual links.

. Create a new block display by clicking _Add_ in the _Displays_ section. Click
_Block_ from the dropdown button. The new display is created, and the focus is
automatically switched to its configuration.

the _Filter criteria_ section. In the pop-up that appears, select _This
block (override)_ from the _For_ select list. Click _Remove_ at the bottom.

. Configure how you want the content to be sorted in the view by clicking _Add_
in the _Sort criteria_ section. In the pop-up that appears, select _This
block (override)_ from the _For_ select list. Check the field _Authored on_
(from Content category), and then _Add and configure sort criteria_.

. In the appearing configuration pop-up, select _Sort descending_ to have the
most recent recipes appear first. Click _Apply_.

. Specify the number of items to be displayed by clicking _Use pager: Mini_ in
the _Pager_ section. In the pop-up that appears, select _This block
(override)_ from the _For_ select list. Under _Pager_, select _Display a
specified number of items_. Click _Apply (this display)_. In the _Block: Pager
options_ pop-up, provide "5" as the value for _Items to display_. Click _Apply_.

. Click _Save_. You will either see the view editing page again, or the Recipes
page, depending on what you did in step 1. You should also see a message saying
that the view has been saved.
