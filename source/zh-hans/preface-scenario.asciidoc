When reading this guide, it is helpful to have a website building project in
mind. The following project scenario provides context and links together
the examples in this guide:

You are making a website for a farmers market. The site needs to display
information about the location and hours of the market, and an About page with
the history of the market. It also needs to list the vendors. Vendors should be
able to edit their listings (including a logo or photo), and post recipes. Site
visitors should be able to browse recipes, or locate recipes using ingredients
that they purchased at the market. Some visitors to your site speak another
language, so the main pages and vendor pages need to be translated.
