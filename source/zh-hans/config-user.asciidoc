==== Goal

Turn off the ability for people to register user accounts on the site. Also,
review and/or edit the email messages generated by the site for events related
to user accounts.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

//==== Site prerequisites

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Configuration_ > _People_ >
_Account settings_ (_admin/config/people/accounts_).

. Under _Registration and cancellation_, select _Administrators only_ as the
people with permissions to register user accounts. You can check _Require email
verification when a visitor creates an account_ in case you want to change the
settings for account registration later on.

. Optionally, change the default email address from which user account
notifications from the farmers market website will be sent. This will help you
maintain a separate email address from the one used for the website in
general. For example, this email address for user account notifications will be
useful for a staff member(s) communicating with vendors.

. Optionally, edit the email templates in the _Emails_ section to customize
automated emails. There are seven email templates available with the core. They
are meant for different user-specific occasions. All of them can be personalized
and three can be disabled via checkboxes: activation, blocking, and
cancellation.
+
You can send out your own text (for example, welcoming the new vendors for whom
accounts were just created) by editing the the _Welcome (new user created by
administrator)_ template.
