=== Conventions of the Guide

[role="summary"]
Understanding the conventions used in this guide.

==== Assumptions and prerequisites

This guide has the following assumptions and prerequisites:

* This guide is organized into topics; see <<preface-organization>> for details.
Many topics include a _Prerequisite knowledge_ section, which lists other
topics whose content knowledge is needed in order to understand the topic you
are reading. Some background knowledge that is not covered in the guide is
also assumed; see <<preface-audience>> for details.

* Many task topics list _Site prerequisites_, which are tasks that you'll need
to have completed on your site before you'll be able to do the task in the
topic you are reading.

* The specifics of the site prerequisites relate to the scenario used throughout
this guide of building a site for a farmers market (see <<preface-scenario>>
for details). You can adapt the tasks to your own scenario, but you will also
need to remember the changes you made when deciding if your site satisfies the
site prerequisites for a task.

* For all task topics after <<install-run>>, there is also an implicit
prerequisite: you must have installed the content management software on your
site, and be logged in to a user account with sufficient permissions to do the
task (such as the user account created when you installed your site, which
automatically has full permissions).

* If you read all the topics in order, and perform all of the steps in the task
topics as you go (staying logged in), you should have the background knowledge
and site prerequisites in place for each topic as you read it.


==== Text conventions

The following conventions are used in the text of this guide:

* The URL _example.com_ means the base URL of your website. See the Navigation
section below for more details on how URLs internal to your site are
indicated.

* Text you should see in the user interface of your site is shown in _italics_,
such as: Click _Save configuration_. This only applies to text in the user
interface that comes from the software, not to text that was entered in a
previous topic. For example, in a topic about editing, you might see this
instruction: Click _Edit_ in the row of the About page (_Edit_ would be in
italics, but About would not be, because the About page was created in a
previous topic).

* URLs, file names, and newly-introduced terminology are also shown in
_italics_.

* Text that you should type at a shell command line is shown in monospace type,
such as:
+
----
drush cr
----

* Within this guide, the word _directory_ is always used to refer to file
directories (which some people prefer to call _folders_).

==== Navigation

To do most of the task topics in this guide, you will need to navigate to one
or more pages in the administrative interface of your site. You might see
something like this in the instructions (this will make more sense after you
have the base software installed):

=============
In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to
_Structure_ > _Taxonomy_ (_admin/structure/taxonomy_).
=============

Navigation instructions like this assume that you have the core Toolbar module
installed, and this example means that in the menu bar at the top of your site,
you would need to click _Manage_ to expose the menu choices, then click
_Structure_, then _Taxonomy_, and that at the end, you would be on a page with
URL _http://example.com/admin/structure/taxonomy_ (if your site base URL is
_http://example.com_).

// Top navigation bar on any admin page, with Manage menu showing.

Here's another example:

=============
In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to
_Configuration_ > _System_ > _Site information_
(_admin/config/system/site-information_).
=============

In this example, after clicking on _Manage_ and _Configuration_, you would need
to find the _System_ section of the page, and within that, click _Site
information_. After that, you'd end up on
_http://example.com/admin/config/system/site-information_.

// System section of admin/config page.

One other note: if you are using the standard administrative core Seven theme,
many "Add" buttons in the administrative interface are displayed with + signs on
them. For instance, on admin/content, the Add new content button appears as
_+ Add new content_. However, this is theme-dependent and is not really part of
the text on the button (for instance, it would not necessarily be read by a
screen reader), so in this guide, the convention is to not mention the + sign
on the buttons.

==== Filling in forms

Many of the task topics in this guide include steps where you will fill out a
web form. In most cases, a screen capture image of the form will be included,
along with a table of the values you will need to enter into each form
field. For example, you might see a table that starts out like this, explaining
the site information form you would see if you navigated to _Configuration_ >
_System_ > _Site information_ (_admin/config/system/site-information_):

[width="100%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|================================
|Field name|Explanation|Example value
|Site name|Name of your site|Anytown Farmers Market
|================================

To use this table, find the field labeled _Site name_ in the form, and enter the
name of your site in this field. An example site name of "Anytown Farmers
Market" is suggested in the table, which relates to the scenario of building a
website for a farmers market that you'll find all through this guide (see
<<preface-scenario>> for details).
