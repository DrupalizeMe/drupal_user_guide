==== Prerequisite knowledge

<<understanding-drupal>>

==== What is Free and Open Source Software?

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is software that is developed by a
community of people, released under a non-commercial license, and whose _source
code_ (the program files that make up the software) is freely available. For
more information on the non-commercial license used by Drupal, see
<<understanding-gpl>>.

==== What is the Drupal project?

The Drupal project is a FOSS project whose purpose is to develop the core
content management system software, as well as add-on modules, additional
themes, translations, documentation, and special-purpose distributions. The
people who contribute their time and money to the Drupal project come from all
over the world, and are a diverse community that comes together for this common
purpose.

The community encompasses many smaller groups who perform many different tasks
such as developing a particular piece of Drupal-related software, writing
documentation, maintaining the security of Drupal software, translating Drupal
software into a particular language, using Drupal for some specific purpose,
and coming together to meet in person within a particular geographical area.

For more on how you can connect to and communicate with the world-wide
community, see <<thoughts-connecting>> and <<thoughts-support>>.

==== What is the Drupal Association?

The https://www.drupal.org/association[Drupal Association] is a non-profit organization
dedicated to supporting the Drupal project and community. Its main functions
are:

* Putting on large conventions around the world
* Maintaining the _Drupal.org_ websites and the servers that they run on
* Promoting Drupal as a web platform
* Supporting Drupal education and training
* Providing grants to the Drupal community in support of its mission
* Raising funds for these purposes
