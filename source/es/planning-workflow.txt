==== What is an editorial workflow?

An _editorial workflow_ is the process organizations follow to create, review,
edit, and publish content. Multiple people in different roles in the
organization can be part of the process. For example, content creators could
collect information and write content; editors could review, edit, ask for
changes, and publish the content once it's ready to be shared with the
audience. Later on, content revisions could go through a simple process for
small changes, or a more complex process with reviews for larger changes.

==== What tools are available for managing workflows?

Published/Unpublished status::
  The Content item entity type supports marking each content item as either
  Published or Unpublished. Viewing permissions are separate for published and
  unpublished content; for example, all site visitors might be able to see
  published content items, while only content creators and editors can see
  unpublished content items.
Revision tracking::
  Some content entity types support revision tracking, meaning that as content
  is revised, the software stores the older revisions, so that they can be
  compared or reverted.
Workflows::
  The core Workflows module lets you define workflow states and transitions,
  beyond just having content be published or unpublished. The companion core
  Content Moderation module lets you assign permissions and roles to the
  workflow transitions. Both can be used with both Content item and Custom block
  entity types.
Block placement::
  The Custom block content entity lets you create a custom block and edit it,
  but only make it visible on the site once it is ready.
