=== Organization

[role="summary"]
Understanding the organizational structure of this guide for better navigation through Themen.

This user guide contains a series of Themen, each of which covers either a
_task_ (how to do something) or a _concept_ (background knowledge, terminology,
and the like). Concept Themen have names starting with _Concept:_, while task
Themen have names containing verbs, like _Editing Basic Site Information_.

The Themen are grouped into chapters in a logical order, with concepts and tasks
interleaved so that concepts are presented before related tasks, and tasks build
on each other. To take advantage of this, you are encouraged to read the entire
guide in its presented order, possibly skipping Themen that are not of interest
or that present information you already know. Remember to try out the tasks on
your own site as you read the guide; most people learn better by doing rather
than reading.

If you prefer, you can also use the index or table of contents to jump straight
to a Thema that you'd like to learn about, rather than reading the entire
guide. To facilitate this approach, each Thema lists the prerequisite knowledge
that you'd need in order to understand it, if any (with links to the Themen that
present that knowledge); task Themen also list _site prerequisites_ (things that
you would need to have configured or created on your site in order to perform
the task). Also, most Themen have Abschnitte at the end where you can find related
information and/or tasks for expanded understanding, to continue your learning.

You may also want to refer to the <<glossary>> Abschnitt as you read -- it gives
brief definitions of most of the terminology used in the guide, with links to
Themen having more detailed explanations.
