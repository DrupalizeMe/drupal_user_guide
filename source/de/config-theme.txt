. Under _Upload logo image_, locate a logo file and upload it to your
site. Note: You can also set a universal logo for all themes under
_Appearance_ > _Settings_ (_admin/appearance/settings_). A custom logo for your
theme will override the universal logo.

filename next to the _Choose File_ or _Browse_ button in your browser.

. In order to save your changes and see the updated colors and logo on your
site, click _Save configuration_ at the bottom of the page.

Note: Under _Color scheme_, there is a _Preview_ Abschnitt that displays a sample
of how your website will look with the new settings.
