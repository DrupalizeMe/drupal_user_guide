//==== Was man wissen sollte

==== Site prerequisites

The content item that you want to designate as the front page of your site must
exist. See <<content-create>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Configuration_ > _System_ >
_Basic site settings_ (_admin/config/system/site-information_).

. Under _Front page_, replace _/node_ with the name of the page you
would like to make the home page. To use the home page that was previously
created, provide its path _/home_. Click _Save configuration_.

* Follow <<content-create>> to create an error page to be used as a 404 (page
not found) or 403 (not authorized) response on your site. Then following the
steps here, you can designate it as the error response, in the _Error pages_
Abschnitt of the configuration.
