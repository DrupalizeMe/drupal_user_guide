(((Cache,clearing)))
(((Cache,rebuilding)))

==== Goal

Clear or rebuild your site's internal caches to ensure they are up-to-date with
the most recent data, using the user interface or Drush.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<prevent-cache>>
* <<install-tools>>

==== Site prerequisites

If you want to use Drush to clear the cache, Drush must be installed. See
<<install-tools>>.

==== Steps

You can use the administrative interface or Drush to clear the cache.

===== Using the administrative interface

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Configuration_ >
_Development_ > _Performance_ (_admin/config/development/performance_).

. Click _Clear all caches_.

. A message saying the cache has been cleared appears at the top of
the page.

===== Using Drush

You can use one of two commands:

* Use the command `drush cache-rebuild` to clear and rebuild all cached data
for a site. After running this command, you will see the output message "Cache
rebuild complete."

* Use the command `drush cc` to see a list of individual caches and then
choose the specific cache you would like to clear. Running this command should
produce output like the following:
+
----
> drush cc
Enter a number to choose which cache to clear.
 [0]  :  Cancel
 [1]  :  drush
 [2]  :  theme-registry
 [3]  :  menu
 [4]  :  css-js
 [5]  :  block
 [6]  :  module-list
 [7]  :  theme-list
 [8]  :  render
 [9]  :  views
----
Choose a cache to clear by entering the number associated with that cache. Press
"Enter" to continue.
