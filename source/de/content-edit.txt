==== Goal

Update the hours on the Home page content item.

==== Was man wissen sollte

<<content-create>>

==== Site prerequisites

A content item for the Home page must exist. See <<content-create>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Content_ (_admin/content_).

. If the content item you want to edit was updated or created recently, it
should appear near the top of the content list on that page. If not, you can
use the _Content type_, _Title_, or other filters to locate the content item.

. Click _Edit_ in the row of the content item you want to edit (Home), to
open the content editing form. Update the opening hours in the _Body_ field. See
<<content-create>> for an explanation of the fields and a screenshot.

. Check _Create new revision_ in the box on the right, if it is not already
checked, and enter a _Revision log message_ explaining what changes you are
making (for example, you might enter "Updated opening hours"). This text
will appear in the revision log for the page.

. Click _Save and keep published_ to save your changes.

. You will be redirected back to the _Content_ administrative page, and there
should be a message showing that the content item was updated.

==== Expand your understanding

As an alternative to the first two steps above, you can also reach the
content edit form as follows:

. Starting from your site's home page, use the site's navigation menus to locate
the page where the content you want to edit is displayed to visitors.

. Most themes will display an _Edit_ link or tab near the top of that page to
people with permission to edit the page; clicking the link will take you to
the full content edit form.

. You could also use the in-place editor (refer to <<content-in-place-edit>>)
from this page.
