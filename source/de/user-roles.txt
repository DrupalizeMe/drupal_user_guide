==== Site prerequisites

The user account that you want to update, and the role you want it to have, must
already exist. See <<user-new-user>>,  <<user-new-role>>, and
<<user-permissions>>.

==== Steps

===== Updating the roles using single-user editing method

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _People_
(_admin/people_).

. Locate the user 1 account (named "admin") to assign it the _Administrator_
role. If it is not immediately visible, use the _Name or email contains_ filter,
or other filters, to narrow down the list.

.  Click _Edit_ to update the user account.

===== Updating the roles using bulk editing method

. If the users Happy Farm and Sweet Honey did not already have the Vendor role,
here is how you would add it. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to
_People_ (_admin/people_).

. Locate Vendor user accounts  _Sweet Honey_ and _Happy Farm_ and check them. If
they are not immediately visible, use the _Name or email contains_ filter, or
other filters, to narrow down the list.

. Select _Add the Vendor role to the selected users_ from the _Action_
select list.
