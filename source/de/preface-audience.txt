=== Audience and Goal

[role="summary"]
Understanding the target audience for this guide, and what they will learn from it.

This guide was written mainly for people with minimal knowledge of the Drupal
content management system. The Themen will help them become skilled at
installing, administering, site building, and/or maintaining the content of a
Drupal-based website. The guide is also aimed at people who already have some
experience with a current or past version of Drupal, and want to expand the
range of their skills and knowledge or update them to the current version.

This guide assumes that you have already decided you want to learn and use
Drupal. If you need to learn more before deciding, see
<<understanding-drupal>>.

Depending on which aspects of Drupal you would like to learn, you will need some
background knowledge to understand this guide: general Internet skills and
knowledge are assumed, and the guide concentrates on how to use the software
itself. For instance, the Abschnitte about installing Drupal on a web server
assume you can obtain web hosting and figure out how to transfer files to your
chosen web host. Similarly, the Abschnitte about content management assume you can
log into a website and fill in a web-based form.

After reading this guide, you should be able to:

* Plan the Inhaltsarchitektur for a Drupal-based site

* Build the site that you planned

* Manage and administer your site

* Understand documentation and blog posts on Themen not covered here, to
expand your knowledge and skills

* Connect with the worldwide Drupal community
