==== Site prerequisites

==== Steps

. If you are using a 1-click install from a hosting provider or demo site, you
will most likely see some or all of the following screens as part of the
installation process. If you uploaded the core files manually, to start the
installer, open a browser and visit the URL that you set up for your hosting.

. Select a language on the first page of the installer; for example,
English. You could optionally choose from any of the other listed languages.
The language files for the chosen language will be downloaded and installed so
that the rest of the installation process can be finished in the chosen
language. After choosing a language, click _Save and continue_.

. Select an installation profile. Installation profiles provide site features
and functions for a specific type of site as a single download containing
the core software, contributed modules, themes, and pre-defined
configuration. Core contains two installation profiles. Select the core
Standard installation profile. Click _Save and continue_.

. The next step in the installer will verify that your system meets the minimum
requirements. If it does not, you'll be presented with an outline of what
needs to be corrected in order to proceed. If it does, the installer will
automatically advance to the next step.

. Provide details of the database you created in the <<install-prepare>>
chapter. Then click _Save and continue_.

. The final step is to configure some basic information about your new site.
Note that the user account you create in this step is the site's admin
account. See <<user-admin-account>> for important information about this unique
account. You can safely name this account "admin", and make sure to choose a
secure and unique password.

Fill in the form with the following information:
