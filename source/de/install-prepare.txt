* <<install-requirements>>
* <<install-tools>>

==== Site prerequisites

If you want to use Drush to install the core software, Drush must be
installed. See <<install-tools>>.

==== Steps

. Choose a method for installing the core software.
+
--
Try a free online demo::
  Use an online provider to get a demo installation of the core software in 20
  minutes or less. See the
  https://www.drupal.org/try-drupal[_Drupal.org_ page "Try Drupal"].

Use a one-click installer from your hosting provider::
  If you choose to install the core software at your hosting provider, your
  hosting provider may have specific documentation and/or a one-click install
  that you can use. See
  https://www.drupal.org/association/supporters/hosting[_Drupal.org's_ list of hosting providers that support Drupal].

Use Drush::
  You will need to have Drush installed and command-line access to the site. See
  <<install-tools>>.

Use the web installer::
  You will need space on a local or hosted web server to install the core
  software manually.

Use a pre-configured environment::
  Use a pre-configured environment or virtual machine that contains Drupal and
  all the required supporting software to install Drupal locally. See the
  Abschnitt for your operating system under
  https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/local-server-setup[Drupal.org's Local server setup guide]
  for possible options.

. If you are installing using Drush or the web installer, set up a URL and
hosting for your site, either at an external hosting provider or on your own
computer. Verify that the hosting is working by putting a simple HTML file in
the web root directory of the hosting, and visiting the URL for your site.

. If you are installing using Drush or the web installer, create a database,
along with a database user account with full access.

. If you are installing using Drush, type the following at the Drush command
line, where _example_ is the name of the directory that the core software will
be downloaded to, and _DB_NAME_, _DB_USER_ and _DB_PASS_ are your database's
credentials:
+
----
drush dl drupal --drupal-project-rename=example
cd example
drush site-install standard --db-url='mysql://DB_USER:DB_PASS@localhost/DB_NAME' --site- name=example
----

. If you are installing using the web installer, upload the core software files
manually. To do this using Git and/or Composer, see <<install-composer>>; to do
this by downloading a zipped archive:

.. Go to _https://www.drupal.org_ and click _Download & Extend_ on the top-level
menu.
+
--
// Download Drupal area of https://www.drupal.org/download.

.. Click the _Download Drupal_ button (of the appropriate version) to be taken
to the Downloads page.
+
--
// Recommended releases Abschnitt of https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal.
image:images/install-prepare-recommended.png["Recommended releases Abschnitt of Drupal downloads page on _Drupal.org_"]
--

.. Click the version you wish to download under _Recommended releases_.
+
--
// File Abschnitt of a recent Drupal release download page, such as
// https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.1.3.

--

.. Download the tar.gz or zip file to your local machine.

.. Upload the downloaded file to your hosting account. Log in to the control
panel and navigate to the _HTML_ directory. Save the file there.

.. Uncompress the tar.gz or zip file, which will create a new directory. If you
do not have terminal access, or your hosting server is not running Linux, your
hosting control panel's file manager should provide a way to extract the
files. If you have terminal access to your hosting server (running Linux), you
can use a command like:
+
----
tar -xzf drupal-8.3.2.tar.gz
----

.. Delete the compressed file from the server, unless your unpacking method
already deleted it.

.. Rename the directory or reconfigure your web hosting, so that the directory
name matches the directory your web hosting is configured to use for your site.


==== Expand your understanding

Run the installer if you chose web installer to install the core software. See
<<install-run>>.
