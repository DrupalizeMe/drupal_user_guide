==== Goal

Create a page listing vendors that will be automatically updated whenever a
vendor is added, deleted, or updated on the site.

==== Was man wissen sollte

* <<views-concept>>
* <<views-parts>>

==== Site prerequisites

* The core Views and Views UI modules must be installed. These are installed for
you when you install with the core Standard installation profile.

* The Vendor content type must exist, with URL and Main image fields. Your
site must have a couple of Vendor content items. See <<structure-content-type>>,
<<structure-fields>>, and <<content-create>>.

* The _Medium (220x220)_ image style must be defined. This is created on your
site when you install the core Image module (installed with the core Standard
installation profile) but can be recreated if deleted. See
<<structure-image-style-create>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Structure_ > _Views_ > _Add
view_ (_admin/structure/views/add_). The _Add view_ wizard appears.

. Fill in the fields as shown below.

place. Change the order of the menu items in the main navigation. See
