==== Goal

Use the in-place editor to add information to the About page without opening
the full editor page.

==== Was man wissen sollte

* <<planning-data-types>>
* <<content-create>>
* <<content-edit>>
* <<config-overview>>

==== Site prerequisites

The About page you want to edit must exist. See <<content-create>>.

==== Steps

Navigate to the About page to edit content with the in-place editor. If the
page has not yet been added to a
navigation menu, you can find and open it by following these steps:

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Content_ (_admin/content_).

. If the content item you want to edit was updated or created recently, it
should appear near the top of the content list on that page. If not, you can
use _Type_, _Title_, or other filters to locate the content item.

. Find the About page and click it.

Once the content you want to edit is being viewed in your browser, follow these
steps to use the quick editor:


. Find the Abschnitt of the page that displays the content you want to edit, and
turn on quick editing mode using the _Quick edit_ contextual link (see
<<config-overview>> for instructions on how to access contextual links). You
will see each editable field on this content item outlined in blue; also,
a hovering dialog box will appear.

. Click the _Body_ text area to begin editing. The _Body_ field
supports a rich text editor. The editing toolbar will be displayed in a
hovering dialog box.

. Add some information about City Market. A _Save_ button will appear in the
hovering dialog box, and the field outline will change color.

. If you are satisfied with your edits, click _Save_ in the hovering dialog
box. If not, click "x" to discard your edits, and confirm. Either way, quick
editing mode will be turned off.

==== Expand your understanding

Try using the full editor on the same content (see <<content-edit>>) and note
that there is much more information that can be edited that is not available in
the quick editor.
