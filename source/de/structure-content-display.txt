==== Goal

Make the content items more readable, accessible, and visibly attractive by
reordering the fields, hiding labels, and tuning the output of the fields.

==== Was man wissen sollte

* <<planning-data-types>>
* <<structure-view-modes>>

==== Site prerequisites

The Vendor content type must exist, it must have Main Image and Vendor URL
fields, and your site must have at least one Vendor content item. See
<<structure-content-type>>, <<structure-fields>>, and <<content-create>>.

==== Steps

. Find and view a Vendor content item you created in <<structure-fields>>.
Notice that there are several things that could be done to improve how the page
looks:
+
  * The Main Image and Vendor URL fields should not have labels.
  * The order of the fields should be changed so that the image comes first.
  * The image should be smaller.

. To fix the first two problems, and update some additional settings, in the
_Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Structure_ > _Content types_
(_admin/structure/types_). Then click _Manage display_ in the dropdown button
for the Vendor content type.
+
--
// Content types list on admin/structure/types, with operations dropdown
// for Vendor content type expanded.

--

. Under the _Label_ column, select _Hidden_ for Main image. Do the same
for Vendor URL.
+
--
// Manage display page for Vendor content type
// (admin/structure/types/manage/vendor/display), with labels for Main
// Image and Vendor URL hidden, and their select lists outlined in red.

--

. Click the gear for the Vendor URL field. Clear the _Trim link text length_
setting.  Links will no longer have a trim length. Check the _Open link in new
window_ checkbox. Now, when the link is clicked, it will open in a new browser
window. Click _Update_.
+
--
// Vendor URL settings form, with trim length cleared, and open link in
// new window checked.

--

. Drag the cross arrows next to the field items to reorder as Main image,
_Body_, Vendor URL, and _Links_.
+
--
// Manage display page for Vendor content type, with order changed.

--

. Click _Save_.

. Find the Vendor content item from step 1 again, and verify that the updates
have been made.

. Repeat similar steps to manage the display of the Recipe content type
fields.

==== Expand your understanding

* Make the main image smaller. See <<structure-image-style-create>>.

* If you do not see the effect of these changes in your site, you might need
to clear the cache. See <<prevent-cache-clear>>.
