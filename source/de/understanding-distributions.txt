==== What are Distributions?

_Distributions_ provide site features and functions for a specific type of site
as a single download containing the core software, contributed modules, themes,
and pre-defined configuration. A distribution makes it possible to set up a
complex, use-specific site in fewer steps than installing and configuring
elements individually.

There are two main types of distributions:

Full-featured Distributions::
  A full-featured distribution is a project that provides a complete solution
  to set up a site for a specialized purpose such as academic, business,
  government, nonprofit, publishing, social, etc. For example, you could use an
  existing distribution for farmers markets to build your own website, or you
  could share your set-up for the farmers market site as a distribution for
  others to use.

Other Distributions::
  Distributions can also be quick-start tools that developers and site
  builders can use as a starting point.
