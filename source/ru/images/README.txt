The images in this directory are mostly automated screen captures, generated by
software in the User Guide Tests project
(https://www.drupal.org/project/user_guide_tests). See the README.txt file in
that project for more information.

NON-AUTOMATED IMAGES
--------------------

A few images could not be generated by automatic screen capture. Here is a list
of the manually-generated images (in order by topic appearance in the guide):

Cover image: coverimg.png -- the SVG source for this image is in the "assets"
directory of this project and is called coverimage.svg. You will need to edit
that file, translate the text "User Guide", then export to PNG.

Running the installer (topic install-run.txt): You will need to run the standard
installer, choosing your language, entering values for the Farmers Market web
site, and take a screenshot of each step. Images:
- install-run-1.png -- Select language
- install-run-2.png -- Select profile (Standard)
- install-run-3.png -- Database
- install-run-4.png -- Installation in progress
- install-run-5.png -- Site configuration
- install-run-6.png -- Site installed configuration

Editing with the In-Place Editor (topic content-in-place-edit.txt). To make
these screenshots, install Drupal with the Standard install profile, and create
an About page with text translated from the English version. Follow the
instructions in the topic to enable in-place editing, and take similar
screenshots.

ENGLISH-ONLY MANUALLY-GENERATED IMAGES
--------------------------------------

A few images are English-only, and should be copied directly from the English
version rather than regenerated. (Most of them are from drupal.org pages,
and they would only need to be updated if the download pages on drupal.org
changed.) Here is a list:

- extend-manual-install-directories.png : A manually-generated image that shows
  the directory structure of "contrib" and "custom" directories under "modules"
- extend-manual-install-download.png: Shot from drupal.org

- extend-module-find_module_finder.png: Shot from drupal.org
- extend-module-find_project_info.png : Shot from drupal.org
- extend-module-find_search_results.png : Shot from drupal.org

- extend-module-install_download.png : Shot from drupal.org

- extend-theme-find_search_results.png : Shot from drupal.org
- extend-theme-find_theme_finder.png : Shot from drupal.org
