(((Content,assigning author)))

==== Goal

Assign Vendor content items Happy Farm and Sweet Honey to the corresponding
Vendor user accounts, so they can edit their own Vendor profiles on the site.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<user-concept>>

==== Site prerequisites

* The Vendor content type must exist, and your site must have at least two
Vendor content items. See <<structure-content-type>>, <<structure-fields>>, and
<<content-create>>.

* User accounts for at least two vendors must exist. See <<user-new-user>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Content_ (_admin/content_).

. Find Vendor content item Happy Farm in the list. If it is not immediately
visible, you can filter the list by _Published status_, _Content type_ (Vendor),
_Title_, or _Language_.  Click _Edit_ for the Vendor content item you would like
to assign an author to.

. Under _Authoring information_, start typing the Vendor's user
name Happy Farm in the _Authored by_ field. The field lists matching user
names. Select the Vendor's user name from the list.
