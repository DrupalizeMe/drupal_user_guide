==== What is an Editorial Workflow?

An Editorial Workflow is the process organizations follow to create, review,
edit and publish content.

Depending on the size and processes of the organization, multiple people in
different roles can be part of the process. For example, content creators
collect information and write content, editors review, edit, ask for changes,
and publish the content once it's considered ready to be shared with the
audience.

In your site, content types can have either a Published or an Unpublished flag
to track their workflow states, that you can set for each content item when
saving:

* Published content items are visible to all visitors of the site.

* Unpublished content items are not visible to the visitors of the site, but can
be seen by authenticated users who have the permissions to view unpublished
versions of specific content items.

Most content entity types support revision tracking, if it is enabled by an
administrator for the entity sub-type. If you have revision tracking enabled,
the software will store old versions of the content each time it's revised, and
add notes about what is changed. This allows you to look at the history and
revert to older versions.

Using the Unpublished flag and Revisions, you can build an editorial workflow
that lets content creators and editors work on the live site without displaying
the content to visitors. When the content is ready to be published, all they
need to do is save it as Published.

Talking about online content, organizations would also want to consider
post-publication phases of the editorial workflow: content teams might need to
update already published content. Some organizations might need a more complex
workflow with the options to configure which content type goes through the
workflow process, set up user roles and permissions, set different workflow
states (for example draft, needs review, published).

For more complex workflows, you can add install or more modules from the
https://www.drupal.org/documentation/modules/workbench[contributed Workbench Suite module]
to your site.
