==== Goal

Create a page listing recipes by duplicating the existing Vendors view.  Modify
the page so that the recipes are displayed in a grid and can by filtered by
ingredients.

==== Prerequisite knowledge

* <<views-concept>>
* <<views-parts>>
* <<views-create>>

==== Site prerequisites

* The Vendor and Recipe content types must exist; both must have Main image
fields, and the Recipe content type must have an Ingredients field. Your site
must also have a couple of Recipe content items. See <<structure-content-type>>,
<<structure-fields>>, <<structure-taxonomy-setup>>, <<structure-form-editing>>,
and <<content-create>>.

* The Vendors view must exist. See <<views-create>>.

==== Steps

. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _Structure_ > _Views_
(_admin/structure/views_). Find the view "Vendors" and click _Duplicate_ in its
dropdown button.

. Name the duplicate "Recipes" and click _Duplicate_. The view configuration
page appears.

. Change the title of the view page to "Recipes" by clicking Vendors in the
_Title_ section. The _Page: The title of this view_ pop-up appears. Type in
"Recipes". Click _Apply_.

. Change from a table to a grid format by clicking _Table_ in the _Format_
section. The _Page: How should this view be styled_ pop-up appears. Check _Grid_
and click _Apply_. The _Page: Style options_ pop-up appears. Retain the default
values and click _Apply_.

. Retain only the title and image fields for the Recipes view by clicking
_Content: Body_ in the _Fields_ section. Click _Remove_ in the pop-up that
appears.

. Change the content type filter to use the Recipe content type by clicking
_Content: Type (=Vendor)_ in the _Filter criteria_ section. In the _Configure
filter criterion: Content: Type_ pop-up, check Recipe and uncheck Vendor. Click
_Apply_.

. Add a further filter that is exposed to visitors by clicking _Add_ in the
_Filter criteria_ section. Search for "ingredients" and check "Ingredients
(field_ingredients)". Click _Add and configure filter criteria_.

. The appearing pop-up offers extra settings on vocabulary and selection
type. Click _Apply and continue_. The next pop-up allows you to expose this
filter to visitors. Fill in the fields as shown below, and click _Apply_.

|================================
| Field name | Explanation| Example value
| Expose this filter to visitors, to allow them to change it | Allow visitors to filter and search | Checked
| Required | Whether a value has to be provided or not | Unchecked
| Label | Label shown for this filter on the view page | Find recipes using...
|================================

. Change the _Path_ label field to "Recipes" by clicking "/vendors" in the _Page
settings_ section. In the pop-up that appears, enter the path "recipes" and
click _Apply_.
+
Note that when editing a view, you enter paths without the leading "/", unlike
on other administrative pages (such as when providing a path to a content item
page).

. Change the menu link title by clicking "Normal: Vendors" in the _Page
settings_ section. In the pop-up that appears, change the title to "Recipes" and
click _Apply_.

. In order to use Ajax (see <<glossary-ajax,Ajax entry in the Glossary>>) to make filtering and paging
faster for users, click _Advanced_ to expand the section for more options. In
the _Other_ section, change _Use AJAX: No_ to "Yes" by clicking _No_ and
checking _Use AJAX_ in the pop-up that appears. Click _Apply_.

. Click _Save_ to save the view.

. Go back to the home page and click Recipes in the navigation to view the new
Recipes page.

==== Expand your understanding

The link to the view in the main navigation will probably not be in the right
place. Change the order of the menu items in the main navigation. See
<<menu-reorder>>.
