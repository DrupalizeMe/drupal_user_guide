=== Practicalities of Contributing

Thank you for your desire to help us create a great User Guide! The sections
below contain information you'll need, in order to contribute your time and
skills to this project.

[[practicalities-quickstart]]
==== Quick Start Guide

Here is an abbreviated guide to contributing to this project. The sections below
have more details about each step.

*Note: Several links require a user name / password -- this is "drupal/drupal"*

*Note: If you contribute your writing to this project, you agree that it will
 be licensed with the CC BY-SA 2.0 license. See <<copyright-license>> for
 details.*

. *Find a topic* to write, edit, or test. See <<practicalities-assignment>>.
. *Create an issue* for your writing/editing phase for your topic, if there is
  not one already. See <<practicalities-issue-create>>. If there is already an
  issue, *assign the issue to yourself* (using the Assigned field in the Issue
  Meta-Data section), and submit your change with a comment saying you plan
  to write/edit this topic.
. *Write or edit* your topic:
  * See <<practicalities-editing>> for practicalities.
  * See <<writing-editing>> for guidelines.
  * If you are  writing a task topic, see <<follow-scenario>> for
    additional guidelines and instructions.
  * *Note about screenshots: don't worry about them being perfect - just make a
    rough cut.*
  * If you need a *Drupal 8 site to work with* (to try your task steps, see what
    has changed since Drupal 7, make screen shots, etc.), you can make a
    temporary site at
    https://simplytest.me[simplytest.me]. Enter "drupal" as the project, and the
    latest 8.x stable version as the version (which should be the default at
    the top of the version list) and launch. This will take you through the
    installer, and after a minute or two you'll have a site to work with for
    24 hours.
. *Submit your work* to the issue. See <<practicalities-submitting>>.
. Optionally, make a "patch" file and submit that to the issue too. Really,
  it's optional; mostly helpful in the Editing phase, but not necessary. See
  <<practicalities-project>> if you want to do this.
. *Add copyright attributions information* to the Issue Summary section of your
  issue. See <<copyright-license>>.
. Make sure you get <<practicalities-recognition,recognized for your work>>.
. Update the status of your issue (in the Issue metadata section) to *"Needs
  review"*, and save.
. *Subscribe to email updates for your issue*. See <<practicalities-subscribe>>.
. *Check on the status* of your issue until your change is "committed" (added to
  the source file repository). You may be asked to make a few changes before
  this happens.
. If you have more time, follow these steps again to write/edit/test a new
  topic.

See also: <<management-channels>> to keep up with project announcements.


[[practicalities-assignment]]
==== Finding a topic to write or edit

The first step in contributing is to find a topic to write or edit. To
avoid duplication of effort and conflicts, please do one of the following to get
assigned a topic:

* Come to one of our regular virtual or in-person meetings or "sprint" work
  days, and ask for an assignment. These are announced on the
  https://groups.drupal.org/documentation[Documentation group on
  Groups.Drupal.org].
* If one of the <<management-coordinators, project coordinators>> is in the
  <<management-contact,documentation IRC channel>>, ask them for an assignment.
* If there is not a meeting or a sprint day when you're ready for an assignment,
  on the
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ov0FyJhKrJe7PYvohzV5UrrLyRaVCy2A0BjjEatqxKw/edit?usp=sharing[topic
  tracking spreadsheet], locate a
  topic that needs a writer or editor. It looks like this:

image:images/spreadsheet.png["Screen shot of the tracking spreadsheet"]

Some notes about the topic tracking spreadsheet:

* The topics are listed, one per row in the spreadsheet, within the outline of
  the guide.
* You can also see their current output. To find the site where the user guide
  output is listed, go to the
  https://www.drupal.org/project/user_guide[User Guide project home page], and
  it is listed there.
* Each topic will go through several writing and editing phases, including
  "Writing the initial draft" and "Copy edit".
* Each phase has a set of 3 columns for the issue link, the person who is
  working on it, and the status.
* You'll want to find a topic that interests you, that you feel comfortable
  writing or editing, that is ready for the phase of writing/editing that you
  want to do, and that is blank in the "Person/date started" column for
  the phase you want to do. For instance, in the screen shot above, the
  "Planning your Site Layout" needs someone to write it, but "Concept:
  Regions in a Theme" is already being worked on by someone else.

Once you have a topic:

* If the topic does not already have an
  issue created for your writing/editing phase, create a new one. See
  <<practicalities-issue-create>>.
* If you are taking over for a topic that already had an issue,
  use the "Assigned" field under "Issue metadata" (near the bottom of the issue
  page) to assign the issue to yourself, and save the changes. You may have to
  expand the Issue metadata section to see the fields. Here's a screen
  shot; Assigned is over on the right:

image:images/issue-metadata.png["Screen shot of the issue meta-data section of
an issue"]

* The project coordinators are subscribed to
  issues for the project, so they will notice your change and update the
  tracking spreadshseet.

If you find that you cannot complete the assignment you took, or need a
different assignment:

. Un-assign the issue (set Assigned to "Unassigned" and save the issue).
. Add a comment explaining that you are not completing it.
. Hopefully, find a different topic to work on by following these steps again.


[[practicalities-issue-create]]
==== Creating a new issue

If you have chosen or been assigned a topic to write or edit, the next step is
to make an issue for your phase of writing or editing. First steps:

. Log in to Drupal.org with your user name and password.
. Visit the https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/user_guide["Issues" page for
  the User Guide project].
. Scan the list (it may be a few pages) or search to make sure there isn't
  already an issue for your phase of writing/editing for your topic. (Search for
  the assigned file name of your topic, such as _block-concept.txt_ ). Note
  that there will be one issue for writing, and separate issues for each
  editing phase.
. If you find an existing
  issue for your topic/phase, return to <<practicalities-assignment>> to make
  sure someone else isn't working on it, and if not, assign the issue to
  yourself.


If there is no existing issue, then follow these steps to create a new one:

. From the Issues page, click "Create new issue".
. Fill in the issue form with the following information:

image:images/issue-form.png["Screen shot of the new issue form"]

.Fields and values
[width="100%",frame="topbot",options="header"]

[Fill in!]
----

[start=3]
. Save the issue.
. Make sure you are subscribed to issue updates. See
  <<practicalities-subscribe>>.


[[practicalities-editing]]
==== Viewing output and editing source files

Once you have an assigned topic, your next step is to look at the topic, see
what needs to be written or edited, and actually edit the source file.

Presumably, if you've <<practicalities-assignment,been assigned a topic>>, you
will know what the assigned file name is for your topic, such as
_understanding-themes.txt_.

You have two options for editing this source file:

* If you are familiar with Git (the revision control system the Drupal project
  uses), you can obtain the source files using Git and then use any text editor
  to edit your file. See <<practicalities-project>>.
* Use the online editor.

To use the online editor:

. Locate the current home of the user guide output. This is always listed on
  the https://www.drupal.org/project/user_guide[User Guide project home page].
. Find your page in the outline, and click the link to see your page. It may be
  a template (if you are in the Writing phase), or it may be a written topic
  that you are editing.
. Locate the _Edit the source file filename.txt_ link (with the file name
    for your topic) in
    the _Source information_ block on the sidebar:

image:images/edit-link.png["Screen shot of the Source information block on
the User Guide output site"]

[start=4]
. Follow that link to edit the page content.
. There is a preview button that will show you the output as you edit.
    You may have to click the button to refresh the preview, or it may
    refresh as you type.
. When you finish your edits use the "Download new file" button to download a
    new version of the source file that contains your edits.

For guidelines to use when writing or editing your topic, see
<<writing-editing>>.


[[practicalities-submitting]]
==== Submitting your writing or editing

After you have selected a topic, created or assigned yourself an issue, done the
writing or editing, and possibly made some images, you will need to submit the
changes on your issue:

. Log in to Drupal.org with your user name and password.
. Find your issue (try the _Your Issues_ link on your user profile page).
. Add a comment with a brief summary of what you wrote or edited. Note whether
  you think it needs more work, any difficulties you encountered, any questions
  you had, and any other pertinent details.
. Change the issue status to "Needs review" (in the Issue metadata section just
  above the comment form).
. Upload the text source file(s) you changed, in the Files section of the issue
(near the bottom; you may need to expand it to see the Upload button).

image:images/issue-files.png["Screen shot of the Files section of an issue"]

[start=6]
. If you made a patch file, also upload that to the Files section. See
  <<practicalities-project>> for instructions. This is completely optional!
. If you have made images, also upload them to the Files section. Note that
  images can be rough -- don't worry about making them perfect at this stage.
. Make sure the attributions information for your topic is included in the issue
  summary (in the Summary and Relationships section). See <<copyright-license>>
  for instructions. (Put it where it says "[Fill in!]" at the bottom of the
  issue summary template from <<practicalities-issue-create>>.)

// Paste in the template from the issue create section above, put in a
// sample topic title and stuff, and take a screen shot of the Issue Summary
// section of an issue, if you need to re-create this.
image:images/issue-summary.png["Screen shot of the Issue Summary section of an issue"]

[start=9]
. Submit your comment and changes.


[[practicalities-recognition]]
==== Getting recognition for your contribution

This guide is a community project, and we have two ways to recognize the
community members who contribute their time to it:

. People who write or edit a topic should also add their names (and optionally,
  their organization or company names) to the Attributions page in the
  User Guide. When you work on an issue, you will put this into the issue
  summary (see <<practicalities-submitting>>) and the project managers will
  add it to the attributions page. This
  attribution information will appear in both e-book and HTML versions of the
  Guide.

. In addition, when you comment on or update a Drupal.org issue in this
  project, the Drupal.org web site will track that contribution to the project.
  If you want your sponsoring organization to get credit for your contributions,
  make sure to fill in the "Attribute this contribution" section of the issue
  comment form:

image:images/issue-attribution.png["Screen shot of Attribute this contribution
section of the issue comment form"]


[[practicalities-subscribe]]
==== Subscribing to email issue updates

If you are writing or editing a topic for this project, you will be using an
issue to communicate with the project managers and submit your writing or
edits. See <<practicalities-issue-create>> for details of how to create an
issue, and <<practicalities-submitting>> for how to submit your changes.

It is important to watch your issue for comments from the project managers,
until it is finalized. You can do this by bookmarking the issue in your browser
and checking it every day or two, or you can subscribe to receive email
updates.

Here are the steps to receive email updates about an issue:

. Log in to your Drupal.org user account, which presumably has a valid email
  address in it (if not, edit your profile).
. Make sure you are "Following" the issue. If you created it or added a
  comment, you should be following it. You can also follow other issues
  by clicking the "Follow" button on the right sidebar. If it already says
  Following, then you are already following the issue.

image:images/issue-follow.png["Screen shot of issue follow button"]

[start=3]
. From your user profile page, click the Notifications link. Make sure the
  "Default notification" says it will send email for "Issues you follow", and
  save.

[[practicalities-project]]
==== Drupal.org project, Git, and patches

*Note: this section is rather technical. You can skip it unless you want to use
 an off-line editor or make a patch file.*

The source files for both this guidelines documentation and the User Guide
itself are located in a https://www.drupal.org/project/user_guide[Drupal.org
project called User Guide]. The source files are managed in a Git revision
control repository; the English-language files for the Guide are in subdirectory
_source/en_, and
other languages will eventually be in similar subdirectories there.

This project uses individual Drupal.org issues to track progress on the
individual writing and editing phases for each topic. There is a
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ov0FyJhKrJe7PYvohzV5UrrLyRaVCy2A0BjjEatqxKw/edit?usp=sharing[tracking
spreadsheet for the topics] that lists all the topics, the issues for each phase
of writing and editing, and their status.

Background on Drupal.org projects and issues:

* https://www.drupal.org/node/24565[Documentation issue reports] -- The
  introduction section at the top is the most relevant part;
  the rest is about issues for the Drupal.org online documentation so it is not
  completely relevant.
* https://www.drupal.org/node/1468332[How to find the issues for a project]
* https://www.drupal.org/node/2276011[Updating or editing an issue report]

Background on Git and patching:

* Any project has a link on the sidebar called "Browse code repository", which
  will take you into the Git repository. From there, click "tree" in the top
  navigation to see the folders and files in the project. Here's a
  http://cgit.drupalcode.org/user_guide/tree/?h=8.0.x[direct link to browse
  the User Guide project source files tree].
* https://www.drupal.org/node/1010894[Installing Git]
* https://www.drupal.org/novice[Novice code contribution guide] - although this
  is oriented towards code, the process of making a patch file for this user
  guide is the same as for Drupal core and contributed modules.
* https://www.drupal.org/node/707484[Making a Drupal patch]
* https://www.drupal.org/project/user_guide/git-instructions[Git instructions
  for this project]

Quick steps for making a patch:

* Install Git (see above).
* Clone the repository (make a local copy):

----
git clone --branch 8.0.x http://git.drupal.org/project/user_guide.git
cd user_guide
----

* Make sure the repository is updated to the latest source files:

----
git pull
----

* Edit the source files, which are in the _source/en_ directory of this
  repository (see <<practicalities-editing>>).
* Make a patch file with this command:

----
git diff > name_of_the_patch_file.patch
----
