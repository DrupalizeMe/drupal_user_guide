[[practicalities]]
=== Practicalities of Contributing

Add some stuff here about where the repo is, projects, patches, which guidelines
to definitely read, where to find templates, how to contact the project
managers, etc.


[[practicalities-coordinators]]
==== Project coordinators

The project coordinators are:

* https://www.drupal.org/u/amber-himes-matz[Amber Matz] - Volunteer coordination
  and project management
* https://www.drupal.org/u/jhodgdon[Jennifer Hodgdon] - Content oversight
* https://www.drupal.org/u/eojthebrave[Joe Shindelar] - Content oversight


[[practicalities-project]]
==== Drupal.org project

The source files for both this guidelines documentation and the User Guide
itself are located in a https://www.drupal.org/project/user_guide[Drupal.org
project called User Guide].

This project uses Drupal.org issues and Git patches to manage changes. There is
a https://www.drupal.org/node/2512362[main tracking issue] where you can find
information on the status of writing and editing all the topics that make up the
guide, and links to issues for each of the individual topics that people are
working on.


[[practicalities-site]]
==== Web site for viewing and editing

Currently, you can view the guidelines and user guide, and edit them on-line, on
a development site (user name/password: drupal/drupal):
https://userguide-drupal.redesign.devdrupal.org/d8guide/en/index.htm
https://userguide-drupal.redesign.devdrupal.org/guidelines/index.html


[[contact]]
==== How to make contact

If you have a question, comment, or suggestion regarding:

Editing the content of the Guide::
  Use an issue. See <<practicalities-project>>.
Guide organization::
  Use an issue. See <<practicalities-project>>.
Getting assigned a topic to write or edit::

Staying informed::
  Subscribe to the https://groups.drupal.org/documentation[Documentation group
  on Groups.Drupal.org].


[[practicalities-assignment]]
==== Getting assigned a topic to write or edit

There are two main ways that you can get assigned a topic to write or edit:

* Come to one of our regular meetings or "sprint" work days, and ask for an
  assignment. These are announced on the
  https://groups.drupal.org/documentation[Documentation group on
  Groups.Drupal.org].
* On the https://www.drupal.org/node/2512362[main tracking issue], locate a
  topic that needs a writer or editor. If the topic does not already have a
  sub-issue created, create a new one,
  following the instructions in the main tracking issue. Then (either on the
  existing issue or the new one you created),
  use the "Assigned" field under "Issue metadata" to assign the issue
  to yourself, and add a comment saying what you plan to do (write or edit) and
  when you plan to do it. The project coordinators are subscribed to issues for
  the project, so they will notice your change and update the tracking issue.

If you complete your assignment, find that you cannot complete the assignment
you took, or need a different assignment, un-assign the issue, add a comment,
and find a new topic to work on (if you want to).
