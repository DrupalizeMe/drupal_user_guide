=== Practicalities of Contributing

Thank you for your desire to help us create a great User Guide! The sections
below contain information you'll need, in order to contribute your time and
skills to this project.


[[practicalities-assignment]]
==== Finding a topic to write or edit

The first step in contributing is to find a topic to write, test, or edit. To
avoid duplication of effort and conflicts, please do one of the following to get
assigned a topic:

* Come to one of our regular virtual or in-person meetings or "sprint" work
  days, and ask for an assignment. These are announced on the
  https://groups.drupal.org/documentation[Documentation group on
  Groups.Drupal.org].
* If one of the <<coordinators, project coordinators>> is in the
  documentation IRC channel (see <<contact>>), ask them for an assignment.
* If there is not a meeting or a sprint day when you're ready for an assignment,
  on the https://www.drupal.org/node/2512362[main tracking issue], locate a
  topic that needs a writer or editor.

Once you have a topic:

. If the topic does not already have a
  sub-issue created, create a new one, following the instructions
  on the https://www.drupal.org/node/2512362[main tracking issue].
. Either on the existing issue or the new one you
  created, use the "Assigned" field under "Issue metadata" to assign the issue
  to yourself.
. Add a comment saying what you plan to do (write or edit) and
  when you plan to do it.
. Save your comment and changes. The project coordinators are subscribed to
  issues for the project, so they will notice your change and update the
  tracking issue.

If you find that you cannot complete the assignment you took, or need a
different assignment:

. Un-assign the issue
. Add a comment explaining that you are not completing it
. Hopefully, find a different topic to work on by following these steps again.


[[practicalities-editing]]
==== Viewing output and editing source files

Once you have an assigned topic, your next step is to look at the topic, see
what needs to be written or edited, and actually edit the source file.

We have set up a temporary site where you can view the in-progress user guide:
https://userguide-drupal.redesign.devdrupal.org/d8guide/en/index.html (the user
name and password are both +drupal+).
The guidelines and instructions for the project are also on this site, at:
https://userguide-drupal.redesign.devdrupal.org/guidelines/index.html
Both of these "books" have navigation on the right sidebar, with expand/collapse
capability.

When you are on a particular topic page, you'll notice there will be a line
like:

_Source file: text-conventions.txt_

This indicates which source file the topic you are viewing was generated
from. If you are working on this topic, you have two choices for how to edit
that file:

* You can use a text editor on your local computer, working off the Git source
  repository for the project. See <<practicalities-project>>.
* You can use the online editor on the temporary site. In the right sidebar
  there is a "Source information" block, and at the bottom there should be a
  link to edit the source file. Click that link, and you can edit the source in
  a window. There is a Preview button that will show you the output as you edit,
  and when you finish your edits, you can use the Download button to download a
  new version of the source file, and save it into the source directory
  _source/en_.

Once you have a new version of one or more source files ready, your next step is
to make a patch; see <<practicalities-project>>.


[[practicalities-recognition]]
==== Getting recognition for your contribution

This guide is a community project, and we have two ways to recognize the
community members who contribute their time to it:

. People who write or edit a topic should also add their names (and optionally,
  their organization or company names) to the _attributions.txt_ file in the
  User Guide. See <<copyright-license>> for details on how to do that. This
  attribution information will appear in e-book and HTML versions of the Guide.

. In addition, when you comment or upload a file on a Drupal.org issue in this
  project, the Drupal.org web site will track that contribution to the project.
  If you want your sponsoring organization to get credit for your contributions,
  you'll need to find the fields on the Drupal issue comment form that
  let you enter or select the organization to credit.


[[practicalities-project]]
==== Drupal.org project, Git, and patches

The source files for both this guidelines documentation and the User Guide
itself are located in a https://www.drupal.org/project/user_guide[Drupal.org
project called User Guide]. The source files are managed in a Git revision
control repository; the English Guide files are in subdirectory _source/en_, and
other languages will eventually be in similar subdirectories there.

This project uses Drupal.org issues to track progress and manage changes. There
is a https://www.drupal.org/node/2512362[main tracking issue] where you can find
information on the status of writing and editing all the topics that make up the
guide, and links to issues for each of the individual topics that people are
working on.

Background on Drupal.org projects and issues:

* https://www.drupal.org/node/24565[Documentation issue reports] -- The
  introduction section at the top is the most relevant part;
  the rest is about issues for the Drupal.org online documentation so it is not
  completely relevant.
* https://www.drupal.org/node/1468332[How to find the issues for a project]
* https://www.drupal.org/node/2276011[Updating or editing an issue report]
* If you are viewing any issue, you can click the "Follow" button in the right
  sidebar, to receive email when the issue is updated. If you comment on an
  issue, you'll automatically be subscribed.

Once you have <<practicalities-assignment,found a topic to write or edit>> (and
located or created its issue), and
<<practicalities-editing,edited the source file for the topic>>, you will need
to submit your changes to the issue. If possible, you should make
a Git differences (or _patch_) file, but if you don't know how to do that, don't
worry! Someone else can help with that. Then go back to your
issue and:

* Upload the text source file(s) you changed, in the Files section of the issue.
* If you made a patch file, also upload that.
* Add a comment with a brief summary of what you wrote or edited. Note whether
  you think it needs more work, any difficulties you encountered, any questions
  you had, and any other pertinent details.
* Change the issue status to "Needs review".
* Submit your comment.

Background on Git and patching:

* https://www.drupal.org/node/1010894[Installing Git]
* https://www.drupal.org/novice[Novice code contribution guide] - although this
  is oriented towards code, the process of making a patch file for this user
  guide is the same as for Drupal core and contributed modules.
* https://www.drupal.org/node/707484[Making a Drupal patch]
* Git instructions for this project:
  https://www.drupal.org/project/user_guide/git-instructions

Quick steps for making a patch:

* Install Git (see above).
* Clone the repository (make a local copy):

----
git clone --branch 8.0.x http://git.drupal.org/project/user_guide.git
cd user_guide
----

* Make sure the repository is updated to the latest source files:

----
git pull
----

* Edit the source files, which are in the _source/en_ directory of this
  repository (see <<practicalities-editing>>).
* Make a patch file with this command:

----
git diff > name_of_the_patch_file.patch
----
