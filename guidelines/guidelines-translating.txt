=== Translation Guidelines

[role="summary"]
Guidelines for translators of the project_name to follow.

*Note: This is a rough draft still!*

* When translating, follow the standard glossary of terminology translations
that your language team has set up for the project_name, so that consistency is
maintained across the entire book.

* You may feel free to communicate on translation issues for the project_name
either in English, or in the language you are translating into.

* Be careful not to change any AsciiDoc formatting. See <<formatting>> for
details.

* Be careful not to change any IDs -- these should stay in English (they are not
visible to the reader). IDs come in two places/types:
** The topic ID at the top of each topic file, which looks like
  `[[id-goes-here]]`.
** Topic IDs used in cross-links, which look like either `<<id-goes-here>>`
  without link text, and `<<id-goes-here,overridden link text>>`. In the second
  format, you should translate the overridden link text, but not the ID.

* If there is a Glossary topic, you will need to re-alphabetize it after
translating the terms and definitions.

* The Index will automatically be re-alphabetized, but you will need to
translate index entries. These look like `(((Main entry,secondary entry)))`.

* *Additional references section in some topics:* This section is for links to
outside references, and most or all are in English. Translators will need to
replace with references in their language if possible. If reference links are
included that are in English or another language that is not the same as the
language you are translating into, make sure that the link text notes that they
are not in the expected language.
