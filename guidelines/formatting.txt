=== Project-specific formatting notes

This section contains a few notes on AsciiDoc syntax and conventions that are
specific to this guide.

[[style-sections]]
==== Chapters and Sections

AsciiDoc supports several syntax styles for indicating chapters and
sections (not all of which are covered in all AsciiDoc manuals). This guide
uses the following syntax, with required identifiers on each chapter and
section:

----
 = Overall Book Title


 [[first_chapter_id]]
 == Chapter Title One


 [[first_section_id]]
 === Section Title Sub 1


 [[first_subsection_id]]
 ==== Section Title SubSub 1
----

For readability of the source, leave two blank lines before the start of each
chapter and section. In this guide, the convention is that the main book title
and chapters are created in the main _guide.txt_ file. Each section is in a
separate include file, with an include statement in the _guide.txt_ file. The
idea is that the sections could be reassembled into different guides if
desired.

When the book is displayed on a web site, each first-level section is displayed
on its own page.

Once you have a chapter or section defined with an identifier,
you can make a cross-link by putting, for example:

----
 <<first_section_id>>
----

into your text. This will be formatted with the title of the section or
chapter, and (depending on the output format) a link and/or page number.


[[style-code]]
==== Code

To include PHP code, prefix a literal block (which starts and ends with +----+
on its own line) with +[source,php]+. Other types of source code are also
recognized, such as +css+, +javascript+, +sql+, +html+, etc. For generic source
code, such as commands to type at an operating system prompt, you can omit the
+[source,php]+ line.


[[style-literals]]
==== Literals and Text Formatting

File names and directories in text should be formatted in italics, as well as
new terms that are introduced:

----
_sites/default.settings.php_
_view_ (in the context of the Views module)
----

Programming details (functions, variables, etc.) and operating system
commands embedded in text should be formatted in monospace:

----
+my_function_name()+
+$foo+
----


[[style-comments]]
==== Comments

You can put comments into your AsciiDoc using double slashes, like PHP:

----
// This is a comment that is only relevant to someone reading
// the AsciiDoc source. It will not be displayed in the output.
----
