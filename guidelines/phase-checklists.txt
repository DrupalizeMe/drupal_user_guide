==== Writing phase issue template and checklist

Use the following issue summary template for issues for writing individual
topics. For each issue, you will need to replace the things in [] with actual
information for the topic. Also, for the link to the instructions on copyright,
put in the URL for <<copyright-license>> in your project's guidelines pages.

----
<strong>Title:</strong>  [Topic title]
<strong>Section:</strong> [Book section name]
<strong>File name:</strong> [File name]
<strong>Covers:</strong> [Copy from the Tracking spreadsheet]

<h4>Attribution</h4>
See [link to the instructions on copyright attributions]

Fill in!

<h4>Checklist for this phase</h4>
- Does it follow the template?
- Have the comments and placeholder text been removed from the template?
- If sections of the template are not needed, are they still there but turned into comments?
- Is everything the topic was supposed to cover included, and nothing extra?
- If there are @todo notes, are they clear?
- If there are images included, do they include instructions for how to redo them in a comment? (Note: Screenshots do not need to be perfect. Just make a rough cut.)
- Is attribution provided?

[[phase-checklists-guidelines]]
==== Guidelines and formatting check phase

After making a commit for the writing phase, the committing project manager
should check for adherence the following guidelines (rather than requiring that
the writer has followed them). If there are problems, the committer can either
file an issue to get another volunteer to make updates, or do the edits directly
and commit the changes. You'll need to run the build scripts to check the
formatting.

Guidelines checklist:

* Does it follow our guidelines for good writing? See <<good-writing>>.
* Does it follow the scenario?
* Does it speak to the intended audience?
* Does it have appropriate index entries?
* Is the navigation described in the standard way? See <<text-navigation>>.

Formatting checklist:

* The formatting of the headers, subheaders, lists, etc. works (no wrong
numbers, etc.). Images do not spill out of margins; narrow images are not
artificially widened (you may need to take out or add +,width="100%"+ in image
tags).

* Text should be wrapped in lines going out to around 80-characters, without
going over, as much as possible. However, lines specifying images, links,
and the like can go over 80 characters to keep the image/link, including
attributes, all together on one line.

* When formatting a bullet list or numbered list, within each list item,
subsequent lines should start at the left margin. Paragraph breaks within a
list item are generated by + signs. Example:

----
. This is a numbered list item. After reaching the 80 character
line length, the next line starts at the left margin.
+
And this is a second paragraph within the same list item.
----

* All of the sections from the appropriate template should be present in both
Task and Concept topics. If they are empty, they should be commented out:

----
// ==== Site prerequisites
----

* Within a particular section, such as Steps, if a sub-heading is needed, it
uses ===== notation rather than just being a sentence in bold or some ad-hoc
formatting like that.

* We don't need a heading at the top of Steps that just repeats the Goal. Just
remove it.

* Bullet lists should never have just one item. Take out the bullet if so and
make it a normal paragraph.

[[phase-checklists-copyedit-task]]
==== Issue template for copy editing by task

Use this issue template for issues about copy editing the entire guide for one
specific guideline. An example guideline for this type of issue:

In the text of the guide, use "website" instead of "web site".

Issue summary template:

<h3>Detailed Instructions for Assigning Issues and Patching</h3>

</ol>

<h4>Editing and making a patch file</h4>
<ol>

<li>Specific Git instructions for the User Guide project can be found at https://www.drupal.org/project/user_guide/git-instructions . Follow the instructions to "clone" the repository (see the "One-time only" instructions).</li>
<li>Make the edits for this issue, using a plain-text editor. The source files are located in the source/en subdirectory, and have extension .txt, and are in AsciiDoc format (see below).</li>
<li>Go back to the specific Git instructions page and follow the instructions there to make a patch file. There are also more detailed git patch instructions in the Git documentation section linked above.</li>
</ol>

<h4>AsciiDoc formatting</h4>

The documentation in this project is formatted using AsciiDoc. The <a href="https://userguide_new-drupal.dev.devdrupal.org/guidelines/formatting.html">Formatting page in the User Guide guidelines</a> <strong>(login: drupal / drupal )</strong> has links and details for how to format text properly, make cross-links between topics, etc.
