[[text-conventions]]
=== Content Conventions

Always follow the https://www.drupal.org/style-guide/content[Drupal.org Style
Guide] when writing and editing this
guide. You may also find the
https://www.drupal.org/node/604342[Interface text conventions] page (which is
about how to design good user interface text for Drupal and modules) useful.

The sections below contain additional conventions to follow when writing for
this guide.


[[drupal-name]]
==== Using the word Drupal

Use the word "Drupal" in the guide as little as possible. People may read this
guide as part of a distribution with a different name, and therefore might not
be aware that they are actually using Drupal behind-the-scenes. Also, the text
in the guide is under an open-source license, encouraging others to reuse
topics without having to edit out unnecessary use of the word "Drupal".

In the introductory sections about what Drupal _is_, we need to use the word
Drupal, but in other sections try using "your site", "the system", or "the Foo
module" as alternatives.


[[drupal-versions]]
==== Drupal Versions

This repository will be branched for new versions of Drupal. So, do not
use the version number in your writing (such as Drupal 8), except
in the top-level book title, and in specific sections about updating from one
version to another. When we branch to the next version, we should then only need
to change the main title and update any version-specific information in the
updating section.

Also, do not refer to earlier versions of Drupal. Just document what the version
of Drupal you are writing about does and how it should be used.


[[text-caps]]
==== References to Drupal components and interface

When referring to a specific module or theme, capitalize it as follows:

* ... the Foo Bar module ...
* ... the Foo Bar theme ...

When referring to text that the user can see in the user interface, use the
_exact_ text that they will see, and put it in italics. (In some places, user
interface text looks a bit awkward, and hopefully will still be changed in the
core code, but use the interface text is at the time of writing.)

Example:

----
Click _Save configuration_.
----

which is formatted as:

Click _Save configuration_.
