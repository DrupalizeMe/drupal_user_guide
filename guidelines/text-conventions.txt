[[text-conventions]]
=== Content Conventions

The following conventions should be followed when authoring this guide.

[[drupal-name]]
==== Using the word Drupal

Use the word "Drupal" in the guide as little as possible. The reason for this
guideline is that some people may download Drupal in a Distribution, which may
somewhat hide the fact that they are actually, behind-the-scenes, using
Drupal. Also, the text in the guide is under an open-source license, so to
encourage re-use of topics, the text should specifically reference Drupal as
little as possible.

So, in the introductory sections about what Drupal is, we'll need to use the
word Drupal. But later in the Guide, try to use words or phrases like "the site"
or "the system" or "the Foo module", instead of specifically mentioning the word
Drupal.


[[drupal-versions]]
==== Drupal Versions

This repository will be branched for new versions of Drupal. So, do not
specifically use the version number in your writing (such as Drupal 8), except
in the top-level book title, and in specific sections about updating from one
version to another. The hope is that when we branch to the next version, we
should just be able to delete the version-specific updating sections, change the
main title in one place, and be done.

Also, do not refer to earlier versions of Drupal. Just document what the version
of Drupal you are writing about does and how it should be used.


[[text-caps]]
==== References to Drupal components and interface

When referring to a specific module or theme, capitalize it as follows:

* ... the Foo Bar module ...
* ... the Foo Bar theme ...

When referring to text that the user can see in the user interface, use the
exact text that they will see, and put it in italics. Example:

----
Click _Save configuration_.
----

which is formatted as:

Click _Save configuration_.
