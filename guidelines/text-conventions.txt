[[text-conventions]]
=== Content Conventions

The sections below contain conventions to follow in your text when writing for
this guide.


[[style-guide]]
==== Follow the Drupal project style guide

Always follow the https://www.drupal.org/style-guide/content[Drupal.org Style
Guide] when writing and editing this
guide. You may also find the
https://www.drupal.org/node/604342[Interface text conventions] page (which is
about how to design good user interface text for Drupal and modules) useful.

[[drupal-name]]
==== Avoid using the word "Drupal"

Use the word "Drupal" in the guide as little as possible. People may read this
guide as part of a distribution with a different name, and therefore might not
be aware that they are actually using Drupal behind-the-scenes. Also, the text
in the guide is under an open-source license, encouraging others to reuse
topics without having to edit out unnecessary use of the word "Drupal".

In the introductory sections about what Drupal _is_, we need to use the word
Drupal, but in other sections try using "your site", "the system", or "the Foo
module" as alternatives.


[[drupal-versions]]
==== Avoid mentioning Drupal versions

This repository will be branched for new versions of Drupal. So, do not
use the version number in your writing (such as Drupal 8), except
in the top-level book title, and in specific sections about updating from one
version to another. When we branch to the next version, we should then only need
to change the main title and update any version-specific information in the
updating section.

Also, do not refer to earlier versions of Drupal. Just document what the version
of Drupal you are writing about does and how it should be used.


[[text-caps]]
==== Reference Drupal components and interface correctly

When referring to a specific module or theme, capitalize it as follows:

* ... the Foo Bar module ...
* ... the Foo Bar theme ...

When referring to text that the user can see in the user interface, use the
_exact_ text that they will see, and put it in italics. (In some places, user
interface text looks a bit awkward, and hopefully will still be changed in the
core code, but use the interface text is at the time of writing.)

Example:

----
Click _Save configuration_.
----

which is formatted as:

Click _Save configuration_.


[[text-navigation]]
==== How to describe navigation

In most task topics, you will need to provide instructions for how to find
pages in the Drupal administrative interface. Here are two examples of how to do
this:

----
In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to
_Structure_ > _Taxonomy_ (admin/structure/taxonomy).

In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to
_Configuration_ > _System_ > _Site information_
(admin/config/system/site-information).
----

Notes:

* Refer to the administrative menu as the "Manage administrative
  menu". (The reason for doing this is that it is sometimes hidden, and to
  make it visible, you click on "Manage" in the top bar of the screen,
  assuming you have the Drupal core Toolbar module enabled.)
* From there, use the exact link text for the links someone would need to
  click; on the Configuration page, also include the name of the
  category/section the link is in.
* Each link text or section is in italics (underscores make words italic in
  AsciiDoc), because it is user interface text (see previous section).
* After the complete navigation, include the path to the page, starting
  with "admin".
* Do NOT include a screen shot of the navigation.


[[composing-index-entries]]
==== Composing index entries

Index entries should usually be two-level entries, such as
+Blocks, creating+ or +Blocks, overview+. They should normally start with a
plural noun. When adding a glossary entry to the index, the index entry should
be +Blocks, definition+.
