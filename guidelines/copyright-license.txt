[[copyright-original]]
==== Contributing original writing

You should adapt or copy existing work (with appropriate license as described
above) whenever possible rather than writing completely new text.

When you contribute your original writing to this project, you agree that it
will be licensed under the CC BY-SA 2.0 license. You should add your name to the
attributions.txt file in the guide that you are contributing to, so that your
copyright is acknowledged. You may also add the name of an organization or
company that sponsored your work. You may turn both your name and your
organization/company name into links; the suggested link for your name would be
your Drupal.org user profile, but you may use a different URL if you prefer.
