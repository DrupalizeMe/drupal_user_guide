[[follow-scenario]]
=== Follow the Scenario

The User Guide has a scenario that is used to provide unity and context to the
topics. Keep the scenario in mind as you write your topics, especially when
writing tasks (for example, if writing a task about creating a content type, the
example should be one of the content types needed to create the scenario site).

The scenario can be found in the Preface section of the user guide.

The following sections contain specifics of how to follow the scenario.


[[scenario-example]]
==== Use the scenario as an example

When writing a task topic, in the Goal, Site prerequisites, Steps, and Follow-on
tasks sections, use the scenario as an example. For instance, in a topic about
creating content types, given a scenario of creating a web site for a farmers
market, these sections could be something like:

Goal::
  Create a new content type; for example, a Vendor content type for vendor
  profiles.
Steps::
  When describing how to fill in the form, your example data values would be
  for the Vendor content type.
Follow-on tasks::
  Create another content type, such as for the Recipe content type.


[[scenario-profile]]
==== Assume previous tasks have been completed

When writing task topics and making screen shots, assume that the site was
installed with the _Standard_ install profile, so that the _Bartik_ theme is
used for visitor-facing pages, and the _Seven_ theme is used for administrative
pages. Also, assume that tasks previous to yours in the Guide have been
completed when you make your screen shots (for instance, there is a task that
changes the color scheme and logo for the Bartik theme).


[[scenario-assets]]
==== Use the provided assets

The project includes several assets (text, images, and color instructions).
Use these assets:

* When providing sample values for form completion, copy and paste the
  text and/or color instructions in appropriate fields.
* When setting up the site for making screen shots of the result of a task,
  use the provided text, colors, and images.

These assets can be found in the
project_cgit_assets_folder_link (click the "plain" link next to a file name to
view it). See also <<practicalities-project>>.

If images from the _assets_ folder appear in your screen shots, you *must
include attributions information* for them in your attributions. There is
information about this in the _README.txt_ file in the _assets_ folder.
