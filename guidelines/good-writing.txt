=== Writing Good Documentation

[[correct-audience]]
==== Speak to the audience

The intended audience for the Guide is site builders with general web knowledge
but no specific knowledge of Drupal. Make sure your writing is appropriate for
this audience.

In terms of the https://www.drupal.org/personas[Drupal community personas], our
goal is to help Learners make a successful transition to Skilled.


[[good-writing-minimal]]
==== Keep it minimal

A good guideline to follow when writing documentation is to keep the writing to
a minimum. Include just enough information so that the information is
conveyed.


[[good-writing-text]]
==== Convey information in text and images

Keep in mind that not all users of this guide can see images. Therefore, we need
to make sure that all of the information is conveyed in the text of the guide,
independent of images.

At the same time, many people learn best through images. So, especially for Task
topics, we want to include screen shots. In a typical task, we would have:

* A screen shot of a form that will be filled out.
* A table of fields and values to fill in. Sample table code (this example is
  for creating a menu link):

----
[width="100%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|================================
|Field name|Explanation|Example value
|Menu link title|Title to be displayed in the menu|Opening hours

(rest of the fields go here)

|================================
----

* The last step would be something that shows them they succeeded (like viewing
  the content if the task is to create the content), with a screen shot of what
  it looks like.

For the mechanics of adding images, see <<formatting-images>>.

[[good-writing-skills]]
==== Focus on skills and knowledge

The objective of the User Guide is to be a learning tool. So although the guide
may contain instructions for specific tasks, those may not be the exact tasks
that a reader will eventually need to perform. Keep this in mind as you write
task topics:

* Think about the skills that someone would need to be able to do
  similar tasks, rather than focusing on a narrowly-defined task.
* When describing the goal and writing the steps for a task topic, make it
  specific by <<follow-scenario,following the scenario>>, but make it clear
  that this is an example (use phrases like "For example").
* In the Follow-on
  tasks section (from the Task topic template), list related tasks that someone
  who has just read your task topic should be able to perform, and that might
  lead them to solidify and broaden their skills and knowledge.


[[good-writing-reuse]]
==== Write reusable topics

Ideally, each topic in this guide should be reusable. To facilitate that:

* Separate task information and concept information into separate
  topics. Cross-reference the concept topic in the task topic, rather than
  describing the concept again.
* Make each concept topic cover one concept rather than multiple
  concepts. Cross-reference related topics and required background knowledge.
* Make each task topic cover the minimal amount of actions that makes sense to
  stand alone. Reference prerequisite and follow-on tasks rather than describing
  them in the same topic.
* The project managers have hopefully followed this guideline when
  they set up the outline. If not,
  bring it to the attention of the project coordinators -- see
  <<management-contact>>.


[[good-writing-best-practices]]
==== Encourage best practices

Make sure that all topics encourage best practices. Considerations to keep in
mind:

* Accessibility: See https://www.drupal.org/node/1637990
* Usability: Make sure that UI text created in examples follows the Drupal User
  Interface text guidelines: https://www.drupal.org/node/604342
* Security: See https://www.drupal.org/security/secure-configuration
* The "Drupal Way": Encourage use of existing modules rather than writing your
  own, etc.
