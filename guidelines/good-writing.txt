=== Writing Good Documentation

[[good-writing-minimal]]
==== Keep it minimal

A good guideline to follow when writing documentation is to keep the writing to
a minimum. Include just enough information so that the information is conveyed.


[[good-writing-reuse]]
==== Write reusable topics

Ideally, each topic in this guide should be reusable. To facilitate that:

* Separate task information and concept information into separate
  topics. Cross-reference the concept topic in the task topic, rather than
  describing the concept again.
* Make each concept topic cover one concept rather than multiple
  concepts. Cross-reference related topics.
* Make each task topic cover the minimal amount of actions that makes sense to
  stand alone. Reference prerequisite and follow-on tasks rather than describing
  them in the same topic.

If you find that the proposed topic outline is not following these guidelines,
bring it to the attention of the project coordinators -- see <<contact>>.


[[good-writing-best-practices]]
==== Follow best practices

Make sure that all topics encourage best practices. Considerations to keep in
mind:

* Accessibility: See https://www.drupal.org/node/1637990
* Usability: Make sure that UI text created in examples follows the Drupal User
  Interface text guidelines: https://www.drupal.org/node/604342
* Security: See https://www.drupal.org/security/secure-configuration
* The "Drupal Way": Encourage use of existing modules rather than writing your
  own, etc.
