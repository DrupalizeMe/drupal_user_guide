=== Writing Good Documentation

[[good-writing-minimal]]
==== Keep it minimal

A good guideline to follow when writing documentation is to keep the writing to
a minimum. Include just enough information so that the information is
conveyed.


[[good-writing-text]]
==== Convey information in text

Keep in mind that not all users of this guide can see images. Therefore, we need
to make sure that all of the information is conveyed in the text of the guide,
and we should also only include images where they actually (for users who can
see them) help to clarify or explain the topic. Not every task topic needs a
screen shot of the user interface, and not every concept topic needs a diagram;
on the other hand, if you find yourself making a long explanation of where to
find a particular user interface element, a screen shot could be helpful.


[[good-writing-skills]]
==== Focus on skills and knowledge

The objective of the User Guide is to be a learning tool. So although the guide
may contain instructions for specific tasks, those may not be the exact tasks
that a reader will eventually need to perform. Keep this in mind as you write
task topics: think about the skills that someone would need to be able to do
similar tasks, rather than focusing on a narrowly-defined task. In the Follow-on
tasks section (from the Task topic template), list related tasks that someone
who has just read your task topic should be able to perform, and that might lead
them to solidify and broaden their skills and knowledge.


[[good-writing-reuse]]
==== Write reusable topics

Ideally, each topic in this guide should be reusable. To facilitate that:

* Separate task information and concept information into separate
  topics. Cross-reference the concept topic in the task topic, rather than
  describing the concept again.
* Make each concept topic cover one concept rather than multiple
  concepts. Cross-reference related topics and required background knowledge.
* Make each task topic cover the minimal amount of actions that makes sense to
  stand alone. Reference prerequisite and follow-on tasks rather than describing
  them in the same topic.

The templates in use for this guide should be of help. If you are the first
person working on a topic, the instructions from the template should be there to
guide you. If someone has already partially or completely followed the
instructions, or they are not present, you can look at the generic templates for
task and concept topics for guidance. The templates are located in the
subdirectory _templates_ in the project Git repository; see
<<practicalities-project>>.

If you find that the proposed topic outline is not following these guidelines,
bring it to the attention of the project coordinators -- see <<contact>>.


[[good-writing-best-practices]]
==== Encourage best practices

Make sure that all topics encourage best practices. Considerations to keep in
mind:

* Accessibility: See https://www.drupal.org/node/1637990
* Usability: Make sure that UI text created in examples follows the Drupal User
  Interface text guidelines: https://www.drupal.org/node/604342
* Security: See https://www.drupal.org/security/secure-configuration
* The "Drupal Way": Encourage use of existing modules rather than writing your
  own, etc.


[[choosing-titles]]
==== Composing titles and index entries

Titles for task topics should be in the format +Verbing a Noun+ or +Verbing
Nouns+; examples:  _Creating a block_, _Configuring date formats_. Titles for
concept topics should usually be in the format +What is a Noun?+ or +What are
Nouns?+; example: _What is a block?_.

Index entries should usually be two-level entries, such as
+Blocks, creating+ or +Blocks, overview+. They should normally start with a
plural noun. When adding a glossary entry to the index, the index entry should
be +Blocks, definition+.
