=== Technical Guidelines for Images

[role="summary"]
Technical details on how to make usable screenshots for the project_name.

This topic contains the technical guidelines for finalizing images in the
Guide. Separate from that, we have several guidelines for topic writers, related
to images (topic writers should just make rough screenshots):

* <<good-writing-text>>
* <<formatting-images>>
* <<text-navigation>>
* <<scenario-assets>>

Here are the technical image guidelines, which mostly apply to screen shots:

* All images should be PNG files.

* Make the image show as small of an area of the page as possible. This means
that window borders, browser toolbars, and the navigation toolbar within the
website should definitely be trimmed away. In addition, if the screen shot is
illustrating how to fill in a small part of a form, or what a small area of the
page looks like, trim so that the image only shows that part of the page.

* The automated screen shot images are captured using an ImageMagick `import`
command, from the command line, and then trimmed. Manually-generated images
should (if possible) also be captured in this manner, so that the dots per inch
and other factors are similar. Use a 72 pixels per inch setting.

* Annotations, such as boxes for highlighting, should be kept to a minimum (it
makes images harder to regenerate). If possible, trim the image instead. If an
annotation is needed, it should be made in red (hex color code: #e62600).

* Firefox browser should be used, with the text zoom set to the default, and the
browser window width about 1200 pixels wide.

* Make sure to set up the website by following the steps in the guide for all
previous topics, before taking the screen shot. Also make sure that no steps
after this topic have been completed, if they would change the screen shot. And
be sure you are using the correct version of the core software.
