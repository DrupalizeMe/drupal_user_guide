=== Translating the Guide

To write up in this section:

* Put into source/[language code]
* Keep file names and IDs the same (in English) -- they are not displayed to the
  user and file names being the same aids in figuring out the correspondence.
* Re-alphabetize the Glossary. Keep the IDs the same (in English).
* Additional references section - find references in your language. Can also
  have a section of links to English references but make sure they are noted as
  such.
