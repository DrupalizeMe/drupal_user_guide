=== Translating the Guide

*Note: This section is rough since we have not gotten to the Translating stage
yet.*

@todo Things to include when we write up in this section:

* Put translations into source/[language code] folder
* Keep file names and IDs the same (in English) -- they are not displayed to the
  user and file names being the same aids in figuring out the correspondence.
* Re-alphabetize the Glossary. Keep the IDs the same (in English).
* Additional references sections - This is for outside references, and most or
  all are in English. Replace with references in your language if possible. You
  can include English references but make sure they are noted as such.
