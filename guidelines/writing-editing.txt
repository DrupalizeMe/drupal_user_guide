=== Writing and Editing Topics

[[writing]]
==== Writing a New Topic

This section is about what you should put into your topic. It assumes you have
already <<practicalities-assignment,found a topic to work on>>, and
<<practicalities-editing, opened the file in your choice of editor>>. Here are
some instructions for writing:

* If you are the first writer on a topic, the file should contain a template,
  with instructions and notes. Follow the instructions in the template file, and
  fill in all or most of the sections.
* Start by trying to find existing documentation on Drupal.org for your
  topic. We do not want to write completely new documentation if there is
  existing good documentation that we can copy or modify. You can also use other
  sources, if they are under the CC BY-SA 2.0 license. *If you do use
  Drupal.org or other sources, you must <<copyright-license,attribute and list
  all of your sources>>*.
* Whether you are writing new text, or editing existing text, follow our
  guidelines on <<good-writing,writing good documentation>>, and the
  <<text-conventions,text and content conventions>>.
* The guide uses the AsciiDoc markdown language. We have some
  <<formatting,reference information on AsciiDoc>>.
* Make sure you <<practicalities-recognition,get recognized for your work>>.
* When you're done with your first draft, we have
  <<practicalities-submitting,instructions on how to submit your work to the
  project>>.


[[editing-testing]]
==== Editing or Testing a Topic

We have several phases of editing:

Guidelines::
  * Does it follow the template?
  * Does it follow our guidelines on
    <<good-writing,writing good documentation>>?
  * Does it follow the scenario?
  * Does it speak to the intended audience?
  * Does it have appropriate index entries?
Accuracy/Testing::
  * Do the instructions work (for task topics)?
  * Does the text match what you see in the user interface (for task topics)?
  * Does the topic make sense?
  * Is there additional background or prerequisite information needed that was
    not mentioned?
  * Does it model
    <<good-writing-best-practices,best practices in site building>>?
Copy::
  * Spelling, punctuation, grammar
  * Clear writing, avoiding jargon, explaining terms and acronyms
  * Could it be said in fewer words or with clearer, simpler language?
  * Does the AsciiDoc formatting work?
  * Does it follow our <<text-conventions,text and content conventions>>, and
    obey the https://www.drupal.org/style-guide/content[Drupal.org style guide]?

[[template-task]]
==== Template for task topics

We have separate templates for topics that cover tasks, and topics that cover
concepts. Here is the template for task topics, including the instructions (this
is file _templates/task-topic.txt_ in the project Git repository):

----
// This template is for a topic that covers how to perform a task.
//
// To use this template:
// - Copy it to your source directory with a new name, such as
//   "block-creating.txt". [The project coordinators may already have done
//   that for you.]
// - Follow the instructions that are contained in lines starting with //
//   throughout this file.
// - Replace placeholder text with your content.
// - Before you submit your topic, remove all the lines in the file that
//   start with // -- these are comments that do not belong in the topic. Also
//   remove any blank lines that are before the ID line.
// - Then, if there are sections that do not apply to your topic (for example,
//   Prerequisites might not), put // before the ==== on that line and leave
//   those lines in the topic file. So it would look like:
//==== Prerequisite knowledge


// The first thing in the file is an ID: replace the text in the brackets below
// so that it matches the name of the file (without the .txt extension; for
// example, [[block-create]] if the file name is block-create.txt.
[[noun-verb]]
// The topic title goes on the next line. Use "Title Case" for topic titles.
// Titles for task topics should be in the format "Verbing a Noun".
=== Verbing a Noun

// The next thing that is needed is an entry for the index:
// - Replace the text in (((Nouns,verbing))) with an appropriate index entry,
//   such as (((Blocks,creating))). You can add additional index entries if
//   appropriate.
// - Refer to the Guidelines if you have questions.
// - Also remove the // before the ((( so that this becomes an index entry
//   and not a comment.
//(((Nouns,verbing)))


==== Goal

// Describe the goal of this task here. This should be the goal for the reader,
// so describe the end result, like "Create an About page". It should relate to
// the Scenario and be specific rather than generic.

Remove this placeholder text.


==== Prerequisite knowledge

// This section should mostly link to topic and concept tasks within
// the guide that someone would need to understand before trying this task.
// Some of the entries could be background knowledge that is needed that is
// not covered in the guide.
//
// Some ideas (remove the // to make these not comments):
//* <<cross-reference-one>>
//* <<cross-reference-two>>
//* How to upload files from your local server to your web server.

Remove this placeholder text.


==== Site prerequisites

// The items below are an example of what might go here for a task where
// a "most recent image" view is created. They describe things that must be
// present on the site (configuration, content, etc.) in order to perform
// this task.
//
// Some ideas (remove the // to make these not comments):
//* A content type is defined with an Image field. See <<cross-reference-one>>.
//* At least one published content item of this type exists. See
//  <<cross-reference-two>>.

Remove this placeholder text.


==== Steps

// This is where you describe the actual steps needed to perform this task.
// Remember to use the scenario and be specific, not generic.

. Text of step one goes here. The subsequent lines of this step need
  to be indented by two spaces.

  And it could be a couple of paragraphs.

[start=2]
. Text of step two goes here. If you preview the output and the numbering is
  wrong, you can use this start=(number) line to set the numbering correctly.

. Text of step 3.

Notes:

* If your task involves filling out a form, include a screen shot.
* Also include a table of fields and values to fill in.
* The last step should be something that shows them the task has been
  completed. Include a screen shot.

==== Follow-on tasks

// In this section, you can make cross-references to other task topics in this
// book that are related. You can also make suggestions for tasks that someone
// who just learned this task might be able to do that are not in the book --
// try to think of tasks that would help someone solidify and broaden their
// skills and knowledge, especially other tasks related to the scenario.
//
// Some ideas (remove the // to make these not comments):
//* <<cross-reference-1>>
//* Brief description of another task not in the book.

Remove this placeholder text.


==== Related concepts

// In this section, add links to related concept topics, if any.

Remove this placeholder text.


==== Additional resources

// In this section, make a list of outside references: videos, Drupal.org
// documentation, etc. Make sure all links have link text showing the name
// of the article or page it being linked to.

Remove this placeholder text.

[[template-concept]]
==== Template for concept topics

We have separate templates for topics that cover tasks, and topics that cover
concepts. Here is the template for concept topics, including the instructions
(this is file _templates/concept-topic.txt_ in the project Git repository):

----
// This template is for a topic that covers a concept.
//
// To use this template:
// - Copy it to your source directory with a new name, such as
//   "blocks-overview.txt". [The project coordinators may already have done
//   that for you.]
// - Follow the instructions that are contained in lines starting with //
//   throughout this file.
// - Replace placeholder text with your content.
// - Before you submit your topic, remove all the lines in the file that
//   start with // -- these are comments that do not belong in the topic. Also
//   remove any blank lines that are before the ID line.
// - Then, if there are sections that do not apply to your topic (for example,
//   Prerequisites might not), put // before the ==== on that line and leave
//   those lines in the topic file. So it would look like:
//==== Prerequisite knowledge


// The first thing in the file is an ID: replace the text in the brackets below
// so that it matches the name of the file (without the .txt extension; for
// example, [[block-overview]] if the file name is block-overview.txt.
[[id-goes-here]]
// The topic title goes on this line. Use "Title Case" for topic titles.
// Titles for Concept topics should start with "What is" or "What are".
=== What is a ...?

// The next thing that is needed is an entry for the index:
// - Replace the text in (((indexentry))) with an appropriate index entry,
//   such as (((Blocks,overview))). You can add additional index entries if
//   appropriate.
// - Refer to the Guidelines if you have questions.
// - Also remove the // before the ((( so that this becomes an index entry
//   and not a comment.
//(((indexentry)))


==== Prerequisite knowledge

// the guide that someone would need to understand before trying this task.
// Some of the entries could be background knowledge that is needed that is
// not covered in the guide.

//* <<cross-reference-one>>
//* <<cross-reference-two>>
//* How to upload files from your local server to your web server.

Remove this placeholder text.


==== Concept: What is a block?

// Describe your concept here. The title of this section should remain
// Concept: ______
// If possible, relate this concept to the specific scenario of the guide,
// perhaps using "for example" language.

Remove this placeholder text.


==== Related topics

// In this section, make cross-references to related tasks and concepts that
// are covered in this book.
// Also remove the // so these lines are a list and not comments:
//* <<cross-reference-1>>
//* <<cross-reference-2>>

Remove this placeholder text.


==== Additional resources

// In this section, make a list of outside references: videos, Drupal.org
// documentation, etc. Make sure all links have link text showing the name
