==== Writing a New Topic

This section is about what you should put into your topic. It assumes you have
already <<practicalities-assignment,found a topic to work on>>, and
<<practicalities-editing, opened the file in your choice of editor>>. Here are
some instructions for writing:

* If you are the first writer on a topic, the file should contain a template,
  with instructions and notes. Follow the instructions in the template file, and
  fill in all or most of the sections.
* Start by trying to find existing documentation on Drupal.org for your
  topic. We do not want to write completely new documentation if there is
  existing good documentation that we can copy or modify. You can also use other
  sources, if they are under the CC BY-SA 2.0 license. *If you do use
  Drupal.org or other sources, you must <<copyright-license,attribute and list
  all of your sources>>*.
* Whether you are writing new text, or editing existing text, follow our
  guidelines on <<good-writing,writing good documentation>>, and the
  <<text-conventions,text and content conventions>>.
* The guide uses the AsciiDoc markdown language. We have some
  <<formatting,reference information on AsciiDoc>>.
* Make sure you <<practicalities-recognition,get recognized for your work>>.
* When you're done with your first draft, we have
  <<practicalities-project,instructions on how to submit your work to the
  project>>.

==== Editing or Testing a Topic

Things to look at when editing a topic (for copy and style):

* Of course, look for typographical errors, clarity problems, punctuation, and
  grammar
* Does it follow our guidelines on <<good-writing,writing good documentation>>?
* Does it follow our <<text-conventions,text and content conventions>>?
* Could it be said in fewer words or with clearer, simpler language?


Things to look at when testing a topic (for accuracy):

* Do the instructions work (for task topics)?
* Does the topic match what you see in the user interface (for task topics)?
* Does the topic make sense?
* Is there additional background or prerequisite information needed that was not
  mentioned?
