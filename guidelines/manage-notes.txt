=== Notes About Project Management

This section contains some notes about how we set up this project and managed
it. It is intended for groups who want to set up a future project, and will be
updated as time goes on.


[[notes-personnel]]
==== Project personnel and recognition

This project was realized with the following participants:

Volunteer coordinator::
  Led meetings, provided status report, assigned and tracked tasks
Content coordinators::
  Three people who oversaw quality and adherence to standards
General volunteers::
  These come in the forms of writers, editors, testers, and graphics people, and
  they wrote the bulk of the topics and made the final screenshots.

For copyright reasons, we needed to attribute copyright to the contributors
anyway. We also used Drupal.org issues and commit authorship to give credit to
people who contributed to the project.


[[notes-project-repo]]
==== Project, revision control, and development site

We thought for a while that due to Drupal.org Git repository policies, we might
not be able to host this project on Drupal.org (due to license
incompatibility). But luckily, this issue was resolved and we were able to use
a Drupal.org project with a Drupal.org git repository.

Since we had standardized on AsciiDoc, we needed to be able to build the output
from source and display it on a site, keeping it updated as we went. Since this
involves installing software on a server, our immediate "solution" was for
Jennifer to do the builds locally, and upload them to a Drupal.org development
site. This is obviously not sustainable, so we'll need to figure out a better
solution eventually.


[[notes-file-structure]]
==== Structure of files in the Guide

We decided to put the source files to the Guide in directories by language, such
as source/en, source/es, etc. This way, all the files for one branch were
together and could be built together into the desired output.

We put all of the files into one flat directory, with an images
subdirectory. Because there were a lot of files, we used a prefix naming system,
such as naming all the topics related to blocks _block-something.txt_. Also, on
the suggestion of one of our participants the first day, we adopted a naming
convention for images that they should be named with a prefix of the text file
name they are included in.

This all seems to be working OK.


[[notes-tracking]]
==== Tracking and making progress

We decided that unlike in some projects, we didn't want to insist that every
topic submitted by the original writer (for instance) was free of typographical
errors. Instead, we used a multi-phase approach, where the different phases of
writing and editing could be done by different people and added to the
repository in each stage as the topic was refined. Types of editing: copy
editing, testing for correctness, and adherence to the guidelines.

Drupal.org issues do not have appropriate status values for tracking this type
of progress. So while we used issues as a vehicle for people to upload files and
patches, we did not find them to be a great way to track progress. Instead we
used a spreadsheet, where each topic was a row, and there were columns for the
topic information (title, file name, what it covers), as well as the who/status
information for each stage of writing and editing.

This seems to be working OK so far, but I'm not sure yet whether the people
working on this guide will be comfortable or quick with the issue process. For
instance, if they submit a topic and we set the issue to "needs work", will they
notice this and fix the problems and resubmit? This remains to be seen.


[[notes-contributor-guide]]
==== Contributor guide, outline, and templates

Before we launched the general volunteers' work on this project, the content
coordinators wrote a contributor guide and made templates. Then we made a topic
outline. We felt that this was good for the coordinators to do rather than
letting the participants suggest topics (we needed to keep the outline limited
and focused on the goals of the book).

We actually started getting topics written before we had finalized the outline:
we picked out a few sets of related topics that we were certain would be in the
book, and opened those up for editing. This seemed to be fine. We maintained a
list (in a separate tab of the Tracking spreadsheet) of all of the topic
suggestions and our decisions as to what should be done about them, and them
moved topics to the Decided tab (the tracking tab) when we decided they should
be worked on.

We had a development site where people could view and edit the files in the
Guide (as well as the Guidelines). In order to build that site, for each topic
we wanted to open up to editing, we had to copy the appropriate template (we had
different templates for Task and Concept topics) to the file name we wanted it
to have, add that to the main Outline file, and then compile the project using
the AsciiDoc tools. This meant that at a minimum, we had to fix the topic ID in
the template file, because AsciiDoc complains if there are duplicate IDs for
topics (and the template explained you needed an ID for each topic).

Lessons learned:

* I think doing it this way (giving people the files as starting points) was a
  good idea, so that we chose the topics that were ready to work on, and their
  file names. It made some extra work for the coordinators, but was good for
  the participants.
* When we copied the templates into their final file names, we discovered that
  it would have been better to put something recognizable for the topic titles
  into the templates (instead of the generic ones in the template files). People
  using the on-line editor otherwise couldn't find the files they were supposed
  to be editing, and that meant that sometimes they picked the wrong file (with
  perhaps the wrong template) to edit.
* The guidelines were long, and people didn't easily see how to get
  started. To remedy that, we posted a 6-step list on the project home page,
  which everyone thinks is much easier to follow.
* The first few participants made a lot of the same mistakes. So, we updated the
  templates so that the correct way of doing things would be explained there.


[[notes-communication]]
==== Communication

We are using the following at the moment for communication; we'll have to wait
and see how it works:

* Posting major announcements on groups.drupal.org/documentation
* Tweeting when we do so from @drupaldocs
* We set up an email list for participants; will see how that works
* The main Tracking issue has a link to the tracking spreadsheet so that
  anyone can see progress (only the project coordinators can edit the sheet)
* Periodic meetings in IRC. We considered Hangouts but were not sure that would
  work well with large numbers of people; on the other hand, IRC may be
  unfamiliar to some people too.
