[[guidelines-writing]]
=== Style Guide for the Writing Phase

The sections below contain guidelines to follow in your text when writing for
this guide. You'll also want to keep in mind the ideas in <<good-writing>>, and
especially if you are writing a task topic, <<follow-scenario>>. If you want to
think ahead, you can also look at <<guidelines-editing>>, but this is not
required.

The guidelines here are partially based on:

* https://www.drupal.org/style-guide/content[Drupal.org Style Guide]
* https://www.drupal.org/node/604342[Drupal.org Interface text conventions page]


[[guideline-lists]]
==== Use lists appropriately

Use numbered lists for sequential task steps, and bullet lists for sets of
options, notes, and the like. Only use a list if it has at least two items in
it. See also <<formatting-paragraph>> for the mechanics of putting lists into
your topic.


[[guideline-text-caps]]
==== Reference Drupal components and interface correctly

When referring to a specific module or theme, capitalize it as follows:

* ... the Foo Bar module ...
* ... the Foo Bar theme ...

When referring to text that the user can see in the user interface, use the
_exact_ text that they will see, and put it in italics.

Example:

----
Click _Save configuration_.
----

which is formatted as:

Click _Save configuration_.


[[text-navigation]]
==== Describing navigation

In most task topics, you will need to provide instructions for how to find
pages in the Drupal administrative interface. Here are two examples of how to do
this:

----
In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to
_Structure_ > _Taxonomy_ (admin/structure/taxonomy).

In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to
_Configuration_ > _System_ > _Site information_
(admin/config/system/site-information).
----

Notes:

* Refer to the administrative menu as the "Manage administrative
menu". (The reason for doing this is that it is sometimes hidden, and to
make it visible, you click on "Manage" in the top bar of the screen,
assuming you have the Drupal core Toolbar module enabled.)

* From there, use the exact link text for the links someone would need to
click; on the Configuration page, also include the name of the
category/section the link is in.

* Each link text or section is in italics (underscores make words italic in
AsciiDoc), because it is user interface text.

* After the complete navigation, include the path to the page, starting
with "admin".

* Do NOT include a screen shot of the navigation.


[[composing-index-entries]]
==== Composing index entries

Index entries should usually be two-level entries, such as +Block, creating+ or
+Block, overview+. Some standards:

* If a noun is used in an entry, it should normally be singular; for example,
+Block+, not +Blocks+.

* Do not make the first-level entry a verb if it's a common action, like
creating, configuring, updating, etc. For instance, we would want
+Block, creating+ not +Creating, block+. Usually the noun being operated on is a
better choice for the first-level entry, but an entry for something like
+Translating+ might make sense.

* Capitalize the first word of the first-level entry, but not the rest of the
entry (unless it's an acronym being written out, or a proper noun).

* Use a gerund-form (-ing) verb in preference to -tion nouns, such as
+Content, translating+, not +Content, translation+.

* When using an acronym in an index main entry, include both the acronym and
what it stands for (make two entries).

* The index entries for glossary definitions should have secondary entry
"definition", such as +Block, definition+.

See <<style-index>> or the templates in <<templates>> for instructions on how to
put index entries into your topic.
