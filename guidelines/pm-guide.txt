[[pm-guide]]
=== Instructions for Project Managers


[[pm-guide-topics]]
==== Adding new topic files

When adding a new topic file to the outline:

. Add the topic to the tracking spreadsheet, filling in the "covers"
  information and defining the file name.
. Copy the correct template file (task or concept) to the desired file name.
. Edit the ID and the topic title in the file -- *the ID should be the file name
  without the .txt extension*.
. Add the file as an include to the guide.txt outline file.
. Commit the changes and (at this point) get Jennifer to put them up on the
  site.


[[pm-guide-guidelines-review]]
==== Reviewing for guidelines

We want to make sure that each topic follows our guidelines. On
<<editing-testing>>, there is a list of what the guidelines review should check
for:

* Does it follow the template?
* Does it follow our guidelines on
   <<good-writing,writing good documentation>>?
* Does it follow the scenario?
* Does it speak to the intended audience?
* Does it have appropriate index entries?

After a topic has been committed to the guide in the Writing phase, it is a good
idea for one of the project content coordinators to review the topic for these
standards, and file an issue with suggestions for what should be changed. Then
post this issue to the tracking spreadsheet, and a project participant can make
the suggested edits.


[[pm-guide-commits]]
==== Committing changes

When committing changes from contributors (writers and editors) to the guide...

All phases:

* Insist on attributions information.
* Insist on valid AsciiDoc because the project will not compile otherwise.
* Make sure to update the attributions.txt file as well as the topic file.
* Make sure to put any attached images in the images directory.
* When making the commit, use the section at the bottom of the image page to
  compose the commit message. Make sure that the author radio button is chosen
  for the primary writer or editor for the issue, and that checkboxes for
  everyone who contributed substantially to this phase are checked.
  This will give everyone involved the proper credit.


Writing phase:

* Require that the template is followed, and that the comments from the template
  have been removed.
* If sections have been omitted, make sure they are still there but commented
  out.
* Make sure everything the topic is supposed to cover is included, and nothing
  more (should have cross-references to additional information rather than
  repeating it).
* If there are @todo notes, make sure that it is clear what needs to be done.
* If images are included, make sure there are instructions for how to redo them,
  in a comment just before the image include.
* Do not insist on perfect writing or perfect adherence to
  guidelines. Point things out "for the next time" and commit as it is.
* Do not insist on perfect screenshots. We'll probably need to redo all of
  them at the end for uniformity, size, resolution, etc., not to mention that
  Drupal 8's UI still is not in its final form.
